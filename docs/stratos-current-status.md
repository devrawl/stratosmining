    Stratos Incentive Testnet Tropos-5

The purpose of the testnet is to validate all the technical design and network topology that can achieve the goal of the project â€” to provide a fully decentralized high-efficiency storage. At this stage, everyone is welcome to participate in the tesnet by setting up and running a node.

This testnet phrase will be ongoing until MainNet is released, sometime in the first half of 2023 and until then, an incentive is being awarded for running a node.
