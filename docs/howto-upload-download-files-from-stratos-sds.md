!!! tip "Note"

    At the moment, you can only upload and/or download files through a running SDS node.

### Get some files

First of all, get some files on your server, save them to your $HOME folder. 

!!! tip
    You can use WinSCP to upload files to your server through SSH.

They can be any type of file, video, music, documents, etc but don't use sensitive or private files.

This is an example file:

```
/home/user/video02.avi
```

!!! note

In order to upload files, your server needs a working SDS node installation.

### Purchase some ozone

Open the ppd terminal with:

```sh
cd $HOME/rsnode
ppd terminal
```

Purchase some ozone (from ppd terminal) with:

!!! note
    You will need to have some stos in your wallet before making the purchase so either claim the faucet or join discord or telegram and request a few stos test tokens.

```
prepay 1stos 0.01stos
```

this will purchase ozone for 1 stos.

!!! note
    Ozone is the currency spent when paying for storing data on the storage network. It's a token used only in the stratos ecosystem, you cannot withdraw it, trade it or sell it. It has no value in the real world.

### Register the node

Run the following command in ppd terminal:

```sh
rp
```

### Upload a file

To upload a file to a sds node, run this command in ppd terminal:

```
put /home/user/video02.avi
```

Response:

!!! info
    fileName~~~~~~~~ video02.avi

    fileHash~~~~~~~~ v05ahm56nv1p2s941ib8pdk75q8oe61fe874alc2

This will give you an unique fileHash for this file. After the upload is completed, run this command to make it available for others to download:

```
sharefile v05ahm56nv1p2s941ib8pdk75q8oe61fe874alc2 0 0
```

Response:

!!! info
    ShareId 0f1e9398bfdf166k
    ShareLink yyLA2h_0f1e9398bfdf166y

### Share the file with others

Invite other SDS node operators to download your file by running this command in their nodes:

```
getsharefile yyLA2h_0f1e9398bfdf166y
```

!!! warning
    Keep in mind: this is not a way to generate rewards. You will only be doing this to test the network.

The files you are uploading and downloading, are stored on other people's resource nodes and they are getting the rewards. 

Â 

### Downloading files

I've prepared a few test files for you to test and try to download. These files are not stored on my resource node and I won't get any rewards if you download them.

Also, i have no control over the nodes where these files are stored so the download might be slow or even break before completion.

To download these files, you will need to have ozone (see upload section on how to purchase ozone).

Open **ppd terminal** and run any or all of these commands:


```sh
getsharefile M4a24B_554279dff1dde78b
getsharefile sRcjQ3_6e12d3a303c77053
