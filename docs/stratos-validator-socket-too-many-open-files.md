<small> Last update: March 12, 2023</small>

A lot of node operators, especially full-chain validator operators, that are running a node on a default Ubuntu installation, will come across this error sooner or later:

!!! failure ""

	    panic: accept routine exited: accept tcp [::]:26656: accept4: too many open files

This is caused by the limit set by default in Ubuntu (and probably other distributions as well).

Check it with:
```
ulimit -Sn
```

If you see a value close to **1024**, you have to increase the limit so the validator can run smoothly. To increase it to 64000. Open this file:

```
sudo nano /etc/security/limits.conf
```

add the following lines at the end of the file (but before # End of file so it looks nice)

```

*		hard	nofile		64000
*		soft	nofile		64000
```

if you're running things as root (which is not recommended btw, you should always login as regular user and use **sudo** when you need to run superuser commands), add these lines too:

```
root		hard	nofile		64000
root		soft	nofile		64000
```

This is how your file is supposed to look:

Exit terminal and re-login through SSH or just reboot your server to be sure.

Alternatively, you could simulate a new login and reload the environment with this command. your-server-username is the name you use to login to your linux server.

![](assets/images/server-username.jpg)

```
su â€“ your-server-username
ulimit -Sn
```

The value printed now should be 64000. If it's still 1024 or 4028, try to reboot your server. Your node shouldn't be crashing anymore from that error.
