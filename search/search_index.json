Previously, I was the cloud team founder of MindGeek, where I built the complete big data ecosystem and led the entire team to provide data services to more than 100 million users per day across all the countries in the world.</p> <p>I was also technical cofounded of Faimdata, an AI company providing consumer data intelligence solutions via computer vision for retailer customers. With experience working across the generations of technology innovations, I am leading the Stratos team to build the Stratos Network that enables the uses of blockchain technology across industries.</p> <p>Stratos is a decentralized infrastructure project which contains blockchain (mainnet), decentralized storage (mainnet), decentralized database (Todo) and decentralized computation (Todo).</p> <p>Stratos is a solid infrastructure for the entire blockchain industry in a decentralized manner. The user and developers can combine the 4 different services together to customize their product. </p> <p>The goal of Stratos is to be the foundation (Decentralized Cloud) of the Blockchain industry and help the blockchain industry to get rid of centralized Cloud service. </p> <p>As an infrastructure project than a consumer project, so it is closer ToB than ToC. So basically, user will use many applications which are built on top of Stratos. At the same time, Stratos team will also implement Stratos product base on Stratos infrastructure.</p> <p>Stratos believes that not only the blockchain industry, but also in fact traditional industries need decentralized solutions. Stratos decentralized CDN, decentralized database and decentralized computation are all required by the traditional industries as well. Therefore, Stratos will form a closed loop within the blockchain industry, and at the same time, it will help the blockchain industry to open a window so that the blockchain can be better used by the traditional industry. More applied business scenarios will make the blockchain industry even stronger.</p>"},{"location":"Stratos-x-DeepCoin-1-12-2023/#technological-advantages","title":"Technological advantages","text":"<p>Beanycrow</p> <p>What are your ways of scaling and developing your project in such a competitive time. And what are your technological advantages over your competitors?</p> <p>Bin</p> <p>This is a great question, I will answer it from several different points.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Stratos team has very valuable experience in traditional business, we know how to implement and deliver decent products to the clients.</p> </li> <li> <p>Distributed system and decentralized network are different, but lots of good knowledge is transferable, which can help Stratos team to avoid the wrong technical decisions.</p> </li> <li> <p>Economic and Consensus side, In the traditional business, capacity is the way to measure the value or reward, for example, a bigger truck can transport more goods than a small one, so it can earn more.  But in the Internet time, capacity is not an efficient way to measure the value any more. More traffic, more eyeball, more attention, more advertiser profit. No any internet companies mention they are the biggest one who own the most data, they only tell the market how much traffic they have per day per hour. </p> </li> </ol> <p>So in the Internet industry, Storage is not the measurement of value, but the traffic is.

Okay, so let's get started. Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to start this session. Welcome to this special Q&amp;A session hosted by DeepCoin Exchange. I'm Akif, the Regional Growth Lead of DeepCoin. So Deepcoin established in November 2018, is a prominent player in the blockchain industry, founded by senior practitioners in the blockchain field and former executives of renowned internal companies and financial institutions. Deepcoin has garnered immense recognition in a short span of time. With over 3 million registered users and across nearly 30 countries and cumulative trading volume surpassing $1 trillion, deepcoin has emerged as a leading platform for cryptocurrency derivatives, and it's introduced around the world. </p> <p>So for today, our guest is Bin Zhu, the founder and CEO of Stratos Network, a Web3 infrastructure startup. He has over 20 years of experience in software development across multiple platforms and technologies. At Stratos, Bin is leading his team of experts to build the next generation of decentralized data mesh, which enables the use of blockchain technology across traditional and future industries. </p> <p>Before founding Stratos, Bin built the cloud department at Mindgeek, a big data ecosystem, leading a team on how to handle petabytes of big data for increased revenue. A tech entrepreneur at heart, Bin also co-founded Faimdata, a company providing AI solutions to identify the true single customer view. </p> <p>So before we dive in at the end of our prepared Q&amp;A, we will be selecting questions from our Twitter replies. So make sure to ask your questions for a chance to win $10 if your question is selected. Without further ado, let's dive in the world of Stratos and discover the transformative potential it holds for the blockchain ecosystem. Hi, Bin, nice to see you here. I have some questions for you, so let's get started. So, Bin, could you please tell us more about yourself and your experience?</p> <p>Bin</p> <p>Yeah, thank you. First of all, thank you for having me and the Stratos network in this AMA. And myself, I have more than 20 years experience in IT and software industry, work experience. I started working in this field after graduating from university. And before I started the Stratos Project, actually, I worked as a developer, database developer, backend developer, and ended up being the manager, director. Before Stratos, I also was a technical co-founder of an AI company located in Montreal, Edville. And in 2021, we decided to start the project, the Stratos. </p> <p>When we started Stratos, we decided to work on decentralized infrastructure because not only me, even a lot of people in our team, are fully experienced in backend too. And we're looking for the opportunities to transfer our valuable knowledge from Web2 to Web3 and know how to solve the problem, how to fill the gap in the decentralized world.</p>"},{"location":"Stratos-x-DeepCoin-28-11-2023/#problems-stratos-solves","title":"Problems Stratos solves","text":"<p>Akif</p> <p>Yes. And thank you for the explanation, Bin. My questions are going on, so here we go. If you're ready. Can you tell us about Stratos? What problems do you solve in this space, especially?</p> <p>Bin</p> <p>Yeah. So Bitcoin was started in 2009 and the ETH in 2015 around. And we saw a lot of public chains are available and now there are more than 100 public chains. This all solved the problem of the decentralized ledger issues. Now it is going very well, but if we want to go to Web3, only using decentralized ledger, public chain, it cannot solve everything, especially the storage, computing, and later on the database, because those have been needed as fundamental functions. It's been needed by everything or dAPP or websites or any GameFi, social media, all need it. </p> <p>So we think that's the gap that we need to fill in the decentralized world. So we start the storage and later on we will start working on the computing and the database. We combine them together. Eventually, we will provide fully decentralized infrastructure to everyone: people, developers, communities. They can use Stratos as something like the decentralized AWS to build their own dAPP or any use case to offer the people to play with Web3 work.</p>"},{"location":"Stratos-x-DeepCoin-28-11-2023/#stratos-performance-updates","title":"Stratos performance updates","text":"<p>Akif</p> <p>Yeah, sounds really interesting. And as you just mentioned, you are right, like the systems getting bigger and the storage requirement probably will be more essential to all of users. So here, I also would like to ask you my third question. So we learned that Stratos recently launched its blockchain and decentralized storage network. Can you please give us some updates about the performance of this amazing milestone?</p> <p>Bin</p> <p>Yeah, we launched our blockchain and decentralized storage in September after around two months of warming up. Right now we have around 357 nodes, storage nodes, are online. And these 357 nodes cross 16 countries in the world. And the total capacity is around 3 PB. And we did some internal tests. Our community members also did some benchmarks. We got a very good result. Actually, our uploading, downloading performance is even better than Google Drive. So people are using Google Drive a lot and they can upload, download the file, store the file in Google Drive. </p> <p>But now, Stratos can provide a similar performance compared to Google Drive. But the difference is in Stratos network, everything you upload or everything you download, they're fully secured, you don't have to worry about the censorship and the ownership of your file always belongs to you, and that's the big difference. And with Stratos, we always give people to see, okay, this is your key, it's your content. It's not your key, not your Bitcoin. It's the same thing. But with centralized storage, you won't have that privilege.</p>"},{"location":"Stratos-x-DeepCoin-28-11-2023/#the-impossible-triangle","title":"The impossible triangle","text":"<p>Akif</p> <p>Yeah, thank you for the answer. And yeah. So let me ask you another question in regards to this. What is the strong point of Stratos considering that it is a decentralized system and that although it has tried to balance between security and efficiency, it is very difficult to achieve it 100% right? So what makes it different from other platforms in the point of the impossible triangle paradox?</p> <p>Bin</p> <p>Well, I think this is the perfect question. Yes. It's very hard to get everything perfectly. We need to compromise. When we designed the system from day one, we need to think, how can we make sure the system is secure, but also be very efficient? That's why we designed the Stratos with three different layers, and we combined three different consensuses together. The top consensus is POA, Proof of Authority is for our meta-layer, because they mainly provide very efficient consensus. They can make sure of all the meta layers, they can quickly respond to the users for any request. In the middle layer is the blockchain layer. We're using the Cosmos SDK and the PoS consensus. </p> <p>And the performance is six seconds per block. And using that, we can secure our tokens, Stratos tokens. We also can secure all the people's content. Hash code will be saved there, as no one has the ability to modify, to change anything in the ledger. The lower layer, as we call the resource layer, we are using proof of traffic. That consensus is running every 10 minutes, this one is a little bit slow, but it has full scalability.</p> <p>That's why right now we have more than 300 nodes, but in the future, they can support 100,000 even more nodes to run across the whole world. And that's why, touching on the impossible triangle, we have three angles, three parts. So we're using each of the consensuses, PoA, PoS, and the proof of the traffic to solve each of them and to make sure the security, the performance, and the scalability could work at the same time. So that's why three layers for us is very important to solve the impossible triangle. Yeah.</p>"},{"location":"Stratos-x-DeepCoin-28-11-2023/#comparison-with-other-projects","title":"Comparison with other projects","text":"<p>Akif</p> <p>Yeah, it is really interesting and very exciting technology improvement from your end. Let me ask you another question quickly. So how does Stratos differentiate from the other leading storage projects like Filecoin or Arweave? You just mentioned Google Cloud, but how about these two projects? What do you say?</p> <p>Bin</p> <p>Yeah, this is a challenging question, to compare to the other similar projects. Yeah, I know. I use a different perspective to mention that. The first one is performance because actually what I can see is Stratos is the most efficient decentralized storage project. To be honest, up to now, we didn't see any of the other decentralized storage performance is as good as ours. We even compete with some centralized solutions. Okay, performance is better. The second thing that's important is the proof of traffic consensus. On the internet, actually, we never care about how much data it's stored. I'll give you one example: Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, or YouTube, or TikTok. Now, the companies they care about, Okay, I'm the biggest company who stores the most data. No one cares. People only care about the traffic. Okay, how many users visit your website per day and how many active users always go to your website every month? That's the measurement for the internet. So because of how much data you save, it cannot come from the financial side or the other side, how much value you can contribute to the internet. I think in Web3, it's the same thing.</p> <p>That's why we use it to improve the traffic. It doesn't matter how much data you save. We care about how much valuable data you save. And like the hot data you have TikTok, it's a very short video, but that video could be viewed a million, 10 million or even more times. If you're saving some useless data, for example, that other people are never interested in. It doesn't matter how much data you save. No one will come here to access them. So that's why we feel the proof of the storage from Filecoin is useful for some people, but it's not that useful for the Web3 economy because they cannot let other people access. They cannot let the people pay attention to generate the traffic. So proof of the traffic to care about and also encourage the content provider and all the miners who participate in the Stratos network, they have to be encouraged to generate the traffic. They'd be encouraged to provide good content in the Stratos network. That's why we feel our consensus makes more sense than the Filecoin proof of storage. That's one. On the other hand, we talk about the cost.</p> <p>Stratos network cost is very low. Compared to the centralized system, it's probably only like 10 % or even less. But compared with other projects like AR, Arweave, our cost is probably 1/10,000 or 1/20,000. So if they cost $2,000, from Arweave's side, they probably only cost less than a dollar on Stratos. So also, compared with Arweave, our performance is much, much better than Arweave. So in this case, it doesn't matter from a consensus level or from the cost level or from how we can build some very good dAPP or use case on top of the decentralized storage. I think Stratos is one of the most reliable and efficient solutions for any developers in this field.</p>"},{"location":"Stratos-x-DeepCoin-28-11-2023/#use-cases","title":"Use cases","text":"<p>Akif</p> <p>Thank you very much for this response, Bin. We just talked about performance etc, my other questions about this. With such a high performance storage network, what dApps or use cases can Stratos empower? What you mentioned above at this part here, please?</p> <p>Bin</p> <p>Yes. Thank you. Actually, when we started to build the Stratos, we talked to a lot of NFT projects. There are a lot of NFT projects out there. And we asked them for the requirements or some pinpoint. They said that some of the projects are using Filecoin, Arweave as the storage, but they're just using them as the backup. They're still using AWS or Google Cloud to store their data, which is requested by the end-user. Okay, that's one. So they need to make two copies. One is in a decentralized way, one is a centralized way. So we realize, okay, if we really want to make some website or dAPP work perfectly, we still need to use a centralized project because they provide very efficient performance to that dAPP or NFT project. </p> <p>So right now, Stratos can provide a similar experience for a NFT project. So for that NFT project, they don't need to go to Google, AWS, and they can directly come to Stratos. They don't need to store their data on multiple platforms. They can just come here. And any of their users can access the pictures, video, audio, video for their NFTs, the Stratos can provide a similar performance like the CDN, content delivery network.</p> <p>That's what they do. That's for NFTs. For the others, Stratos is a very high performance storage network. We allow people to upload videos for the content creator. But when any users want to watch the video or listen to the audio, they don't need to download it. They can directly stream the video or audio from Stratos network. There's something like TikTok or YouTube. When you watch YouTube, TikTok, you never download it. You just play it right away and the Stratos network could do that as well. So you don't need to download. You can directly stream. Every time when you stream the video, audio, yeah, also the proof of traffic starts to work. They will calculate how much traffic you generated and also calculate the reward for the miner and for the content provider. </p> <p>That's one. Since the performance is important, users also can build something like the decentralized email system. They can send the content or messages from the blockchain or from other message information systems. But the important part is attachment. So they can add the attachment to the Stratos network. If they want to deliver an email attachment to their friends, they just upload that attachment to Stratos, then their friends can download the important attachment from Stratos as well.</p> <p>That one could be done in a few seconds. Or, if it's a big one, it could be done in minutes. So that's also an important and secure channel to let the people feel comfortable to transfer that data between each other across the world. That could be another important use case in the future. Also, SocialFi and GameFi, they also need very efficient storage to store all the images and all the chat histories, etc. That also could be a very useful use case for Stratos as well.</p>"},{"location":"Stratos-x-DeepCoin-28-11-2023/#stratos-mining","title":"Stratos mining","text":"<p>Akif</p> <p>Right. Thank you for the answer, Bin. My other question is how does one participate to be a miner?</p> <p>Bin</p> <p>When they start mining in general, they need to have very specific hardware. But we didn't ask people to have very expensive hardware to build their mining machine. We just ask people for a decent CPU and have good RAM with good bandwidth. Okay, bandwidth. Your network must have good uploading, downloading bandwidth. That's important. Then with the storage, it's good. And that's why right now, two months after mainnet launch, we already have 357 miners participating. A lot of them come from Europe, North America and Asia, China, Singapore, and a lot of countries in Europe. </p> <p>Yes. I know some of them using some small data centers. I also know a lot of them just run their mining node in their house, in their condo, in their basement. That's why we don't need any particular, expensive hardware. As long as you're interested in participating in the Stratos mining, you can just purchase some general hardware, make sure your network is good, then you can start mining. And we have three tiers for mining nodes. If you don't want to spend too much money, you can participate as tier one. If you want to be a very powerful miner, you can participate as tier three, which needs better hardware.</p> <p>In the future, when the enterprise or the business users are using the Stratos, the most important traffic will go to the tier three, because tier three hardware is better than tier one, tier two. So based on your budget, you can pick which tier you want to participate in. I think that is very flexible for anyone who wants to try. Thank you.</p>"},{"location":"Stratos-x-DeepCoin-28-11-2023/#storage-data-types","title":"Storage data types","text":"<p>Akif</p> <p>Yeah, I see. Understood. My other question is, could you tell us more about how the Stratos manage different data types? For example, on structured images and videos full of similar rules, or how are they segregated? Is or could be some type of AI used for storage selection? What do you say?</p> <p>Bin</p> <p>Okay, actually, Stratos is open to any type of data. It doesn't matter. It's just word, Excel, or video, audio, or any other crypto data we don't pick. And also we don't pick the number of files as well. You can just upload one image or you can upload a couple of terabytes of data. It's fine. It's all working. Just when the file starts getting bigger, you take a longer time to upload and download. That's it. So the only difference is if you upload the video, we will detect, okay, this is the video. </p> <p>And because like I said, Stratos network could be streaming the video directly. So when you upload the video, sometimes we will do a little bit of encoding services when you upload it. And since video will be streaming somehow for some users and the slices for the video and the slices for all the other types of the file is a little bit different. And for the video, we will slice them every 10 mb, but for the others, each slice size will be 30 mb. So that's a little bit different, but all the others are the same.</p>"},{"location":"Stratos-x-DeepCoin-28-11-2023/#benefits-for-developers","title":"Benefits for developers","text":"<p>Akif</p> <p>All right. Good to know. Thank you for sharing the information. And my other question is regarding the benefits of the project. So as an infrastructure project, how can developers or builders benefit from your solution or how can they collaborate with you?</p> <p>Bin</p> <p>Yeah, that's a good question. We already talked to some community developers and builders in the crypto world. And as I know, a lot of builders and developers, they're looking for a reliable decentralized storage for them. And they tried some of the projects, but that was not good enough for them to build on. Now we have Stratos, we give them another option. I think some developers are excited to build something on Stratos. </p> <p>Right now we have a couple of developers and they are ready to participate in our grant program and they will start to build something like, the Google Drive, they could call it Stratos Drive or something similar. They are ready to start to build that on top of Stratos. And some people, they also tried to build some decentralized YouTube or decentralized TikTok, on Stratos as well. That's what they couldn't do before. And it's not only developers and builders who will get the benefit from that. They'll finally find some use for decentralized infrastructure they could believe they can use. Also, we will launch a new program that will benefit the content creator. I know there are a lot of KOL, influencers.</p> <p>They're using Twitter, they're using YouTube a lot. And all their IP, all their content belongs to Twitter and YouTube. Sometimes in the centralized system, they can just delete your content and ban your account without notifying you, but all your assets are there. So Stratos also could reward any content producer. When they upload their content, their videos, very valuable videos to Stratos so if their followers, their fans are goint to watch the video, watch anything from that influencer or KOL, this KOL, influencer, they will get rewarded. They will get a lot of reward based on the traffic they're content has created. That's very organic.</p> <p>Yeah. I mean, for content creators, if they're using Stratos, they will never worry about their account being banned and they never have to worry that their content will be gone without someone notify them. That's it.</p>"},{"location":"Stratos-x-DeepCoin-28-11-2023/#future-plans","title":"Future plans","text":"<p>Akif</p> <p>Thank you for the informative answer. So let's talk about your roadmap for the project. So what does Stratos plan for the future? Any other milestones in the road map to share with us right now?</p> <p>Bin</p> <p>We already reached our first roadmap and we delivered the blockchain and the storage. And the next roadmap, we're not rushing to deliver the computing component and the database component. The current roadmap, we really want to deliver some dAPP that will be powered by Stratos network. We also want to build some useful dAPP for the users. Also partner with developers, also partner with potential enterprise business and help them to start using Stratos and to help them to migrate from centralized storage systems to the decentralized storage system. </p> <p>So we want to make sure that Stratos storage could be used not only by individual users, not only be used by the crypto world, but also could be used by traditional business users. Yeah, that's the next milestone we want to reach. Then when more and more data will be stored on the Stratos network, then we will start to launch the computing component. That will enable users to use computing power directly to process the data which already exists in the Stratos storage network.</p>"},{"location":"Stratos-x-DeepCoin-28-11-2023/#stratos-on-deepcoin","title":"Stratos on DeepCoin","text":"<p>Akif</p> <p>Thank you very much. I definitely look forward to hearing more info and realizing the roadmap from your end. Thank you very much. I would like to mention something here. Since Stratos gets listed on our Perpetual Trading Platform at 09:00 UTC today, many users might want to ask if futures trading is more profitable than spot trading. Well, there are several things to highlight actually. First of all, leverage makes futures trading extremely capital efficient. Also, secondly, our futures trading has more flexibility for long or short, which means futures contracts allow you to profit from short term price movement in either direction. So our futures contracts can also be used to protect against unexpected risk and extreme price volatility. Moreover, its robust liquidity promotes price discovery and allows traders to transact in the market quickly and efficiently. So Mr. Zhu, why does Stratos choose Deepcoin to do two initial futures listing? And any investment insights that you would like to share with us in terms of futures trading work for Stratos?</p> <p>Bin</p> <p>Yeah, Actually, this is the first futures listing for Stratos. Stratos tokens are listed on several exchanges, but there are no futures listings. So this is new stuff for Stratos and for ourselves. We really want to try to make more people happy and appeal to some bigger investors. They like the futures of trading and we want to let more people know us and more people to try to do a different way of trading and to get benefit from Stratos. And we also want from the futures dealing, probably we can get more liquidity and improve our liquidity as well. That's one important thing. The second thing we really want to work with Deepcoin is, recently, a lot of members from the Stratos community, they come from Europe. They're using Gate. They are using the other exchange. But because of some regulation of Europe, a lot of exchanges have left that big market. But Deepcoin, they're still providing the service to the European communities. That's important for us. So that's the other way we want to open the other door for our community members who are located in Europe.</p>"},{"location":"Stratos-x-DeepCoin-28-11-2023/#data-security","title":"Data security","text":"<p>Akif</p> <p>Right. It's really nice to hear from your end. Thank you very much. Thank you, Bin. Now let's tie things up with some fun, selected questions. Now we have Mr. Bin Zhu here ready to tackle anything. We have selected some questions from our Twitter replies. Let me get started on the first one. One of our followers asks, What mechanism have Stratos Network implemented to overcome challenges which most data storage platforms encounter, such as data vulnerability and thieves? Can you give us a breakdown on the type of data users will be able to upload on your platform? This is the first question to you.</p> <p>Bin</p> <p>Yeah, the first question. Actually, the problem this question mentioned is always happening in the centralized system. They always have back doors, they have another way to steal the data. Because when they break through the firewall, actually everything is there for them so easy to pick up. But for Stratos, the decentralized storage solution, when the user uploads their data, their data will be split to multiple slices, and each of the slices will be in a different location. Also their slices and other data will be encrypted. </p> <p>So even regarding miners, because they store your data on their machines, even if that miner would want to steal your data, they only can get part of your data. That's one. Even if they get that data, they don't know what that data is because that data is being encoded and encrypted. So they don't know what that is. So that's why when you store your data on Stratos, there is no one that can steal it, even the host who helps you to store your data. They also cannot get your data. So we're using totally different strategies compared to the centralized system. So you don't need to worry anymore.</p> <p>So okay, Don't worry about who will be watching you. Don't worry about the censorship. Don't worry about anyone can steal your data by any third-party people. The only thing you need to do: hold your private key. Then you always have the permission to access your data and also prove you are the owner of the data. The second question is what type of the data you would be able to upload? Yeah, you can upload any type of data. You can upload any size of data to Stratos.</p> <p>Akif</p>"},{"location":"Stratos-x-DeepCoin-28-11-2023/#ongoing-projects","title":"Ongoing projects","text":"<p>Thanks for the answers. Let me go through the second question. Yeah. So could you provide examples of successful projects or applications that have utilized the Stratos network for decentralized storage database and computation?</p> <p>Bin</p> <p>Yeah, this is a good question, but as you know, we just launched our mainnet two months ago and right now our network is in a good shape with more than 300 nodes. So we don't have any successful projects I can demo to you guys because the people just started to build on that. But I talked to some builders and they feel very comfortable using Stratos. They feel that the performance is good and it's reliable. </p> <p>And we also talk to some miners, they feel very good and have a good feeling about Stratos and their network and their performance is good. So maybe in the future we will share, we will keep the Stratos communitie in the loop. Once we have a successful project launched, probably we can do another AMA to cooperate with the other project to let ourselves tell the feeling, what is the feeling to use the Stratos network? Thank you.</p>"},{"location":"Stratos-x-DeepCoin-28-11-2023/#story-behind-the-name","title":"Story behind the name","text":"<p>Akif</p> <p>Right. Sounds good. And let me come up with the other question. So could you please tell us the story behind the name of Stratos Network? How did you get the inspiration to build yours? And how will this name affect people in your opinion? It's about more or less branding, right?</p> <p>Bin</p> <p>Yes. Actually, there are two. One is why we call it Stratos, the other one is why we want to build a Stratos network. It means why we are building that. Actually, myself and part of my team were working for one of the biggest website in the world. And in that company, I've been working for almost eight years, and we build a big infrastructure for that company. That infrastructure provides services to a hundred million users per day, and that infrastructure processes a hundred billion records per day. So we got a lot of valuable experience on how to build the system across the world. </p> <p>So after that, we realized this is a very valuable experience and the knowledge we already got. Why not contribute this value and convert the knowledge from the centralized system to the decentralized system? That's why I think we're the right team to deliver a decentralized infrastructure like Stratos, that's one. </p> <p>Okay, the second question, why are we call Stratos? Yeah, in this industry, people like to go to the moon, go to Mars, right? That's two. But from us, we really don't want to go so far. We can go to the stratosphere, stratosphere around the world, around the Earth, and actually protects Earth. So we think we really want to build a fully decentralized layer to cross around the Earth and the Web3 world. </p> <p>Okay, anyone, they want to build the dAPP, anyone that needs decentralized infrastructure services, they can use Stratos, because Stratos just runs for you, protects you, and helps you to make everyone's lives better. That's why we cannot call it Stratosphere, the name is too long. That's why we cut the second part then we call Stratos.</p>"},{"location":"Stratos-x-DeepCoin-28-11-2023/#price-discussion","title":"Price discussion","text":"<p>Akif</p> <p>Right. Thanks for the answer. And so let me go through another question. Yeah, pump and dump schemes are becoming a major problem in the crypto space, which needs solving investors' hard-earned money going down the drain. So at this point, could you please tell how we'll prevent whales from manipulating the price pump and dump, ensure the price appreciates and reach for the moon? What do you say? That's a very interesting question.</p> <p>Bin</p> <p>Actually, I want everyone who holds the Stratos token or anyone who invested to know that Stratos is really a unique project. This is not like the other Dodge Coin or the other tokens, meme tokens. And the Stratos project is fully backed up by the technology and by the use cases. Probably for some people it is boring or for some people it's just too complicated. So we really like the Stratos community to get rich or get rewards when the Stratos network is being used by the community, by other projects. </p> <p>We're using this way actually to capture the value, to add in the value to Stratos project based on our product. It's not purely based on the marketing, because we believe that a project that could be easily pumped by marketing is going to be dumped just as easily, because the marketing cannot keep the price up for too long. The marketing only can keep a couple of days, one month, let's say, then the token price will drop. But if you have a solid project, you have a solid product, and the more and more people start using your product, your price, your token price will be much stronger.</p> <p>Probably they will start to risk slowly, but when they get there, they have fully valued stuff behind that to support that. If you check, you probably can check Tesla, you can check Google, you can check Amazon, stock price. So when they go up, they are very hard for them to go down, but they keep going up. Stratos really wants to go that way. Everything, all the value will be supported and behind by our good product and technology.

Can you tell us more about the team in detail?</p> <p>Bin</p> <p>Actually, like I said, one-third of the team members, they've been working with me for a long, long time. Some members were working with me in my previous company. They believe in me. So when I started the new project, they followed me. And the other information about most of the 80, 90 % of the team members are located in Canada, mostly in Montreal and Toronto. We also have some good developers that come from Europe. And we have a couple of members overseas and we're working very closely. </p> <p>After the COVID-19, all the team members are working remotely. We don't have an office right now because everyone is in their homes. We have routine meetings every day and we have a conversation every day.

That means we are about to start our evening AMA X space with Bin Zhu from Stratos Network. I'm really excited about this particular conversation because myself and Pablo from coin market league have been talking about just how significant DePIN is with regards to what's going to be happening in 2024 onwards. We're really thinking that this is going to be a very strong narrative. </p> <p>But what I like to do Bin, with these conversations on a Sunday night is have them very relaxed and conversational. We let the conversation flow, we talk about different topics within the things rather it being too structured and too formal. And I also like to try and deliver it in a Layman's style. So if you can break everything down into almost like Johnny age five language, so that our listeners at all different levels on their web3 journey can comprehend the language that we're using, the terminology, that sort of thing, and they can actually apply that knowledge potentially. </p> <p>So I want them to come away from here not just insightful evening, but also an educational evening. So if that's all good. First of all, Bin, before we get into Stratos, before we get into DePIN, can you kind of just give us a little insight into your journey into web3?</p> <p>How did that kind of begin? What inspired you? What was the trigger for you to come into the space?</p> <p></p> <p>Bin Zhu</p> <p>Sure, let's begin. Before delving into the realm of crypto, I'd like to share a bit about myself, as it lays the groundwork for why a shift to a decentralized infrastructure like Stratos is significant. Prior to my introduction to the world of cryptocurrency, I had spent numerous years in the traditional technical industry. To date, my focus has been on the technical side for over two decades since my graduation from university in 2000. Fast forward to 2024, during my tenure in the traditional technical business, I specialized in backend operations. When we talk about the backend, it's not just about the user interface (UI); it predominantly involves handling the business logic. This entails coding in languages like Java, C, and C++, working with databases, and orchestrating the architecture of entire systems. I excelled in this domain.</p> <p>A pivotal moment came when giants like Amazon, Google, and Facebook emerged. At that time, I was in China, where web2 was gaining traction. Web2 marked a shift from the conventional single-server setup, often on large servers like IBM or HP. Instead, the focus shifted to a distributed system. Unlike the centralized approach, this distributed system catered to web2 customers from various locations. Prior to the advent of the web, customers were typically confined to specific regions, providing services to a particular country, city or province.</p> <p>The landscape changed dramatically post web2. Customers now hail from all corners of the globe. It no longer matters where you are; you can easily watch content on YouTube or make purchases on Amazon. The customer base has become truly global. In response to this shift, IT infrastructure underwent a transformation. Faced with the need to serve people worldwide, individuals like us began pondering how to construct a system with a global reach. The solution was to move away from reliance on massive servers. Instead, we opted to break down the computation and storage components, distributing them across different locations. Some pieces found a home in Europe, others in the US, and yet others in Asia, all seamlessly communicating with one another for optimal efficiency. This laid the foundation for the construction of the web2 infrastructure.</p> <p>Companies like Google, AWS, and other public cloud services followed suit. They adopted a similar approach, breaking down their colossal data centers into smaller, globally distributed units. This was the essence of web2 - a robust and rapidly expanding distributed infrastructure. The results were evident in various sectors, such as gaming and social media, where businesses could swiftly extend their reach worldwide. A popular game, for instance, could experience rapid growth within a matter of months.</p> <p>The robust infrastructure of web2 deserves our appreciation. In my journey, it became evident that the solid foundation laid by web2 was crucial. Personally, this understanding shaped my work. Around 2015-2016, and particularly in 2017, my attention turned to cryptocurrencies, starting with Ethereum. I found the concept intriguing. The discussions were evolving beyond mere distribution to focus on decentralization. It struck me that decentralization wasn't just a technical matter; it had profound implications for our lives, offering a means to champion free speech.</p> <p>The rising concerns about censorship and the need for individuals to safeguard their freedom, perspectives, and digital properties from the control of major corporations became increasingly apparent. Platforms like TikTok, YouTube, and Facebook exhibited a power to ban users, delete content, or remove individuals based on their actions. This realization prompted us to consider leveraging the successful experiences and principles of distributed systems and transitioning towards decentralized systems.</p> <p>Hence, the idea emerged\u2014why not take the proven successes of distributed systems and adapt them to the decentralized paradigm? This realization became the driving force behind our entry into the world of crypto and, subsequently, our engagement with Stratos, a journey that commenced in 2021.</p> <p></p> <p>BullRingCrypto</p> <p>Yeah, that's fantastic. It's really insightful, actually, that you've been in the space, the web2 space, for just so many years, 20 plus years now on that journey. And with the technical back end and also the way that you were speaking there about the big social media platforms and being those gatekeepers. It's one of the things that I don't have a technical background. I'm more on the soft skills side. But for me it's how do we get that right in web3, we can see that there's considerable challenges around this banning and the social media platforms having their own political beliefs, et cetera. </p> <p>And if you're kind of standing and posting content, then you may get those not necessarily getting the same kind of engagement because they have algorithms that can control that. So whether it's things like pornography and weaponry and that how do we in the web3 environment be adequate gatekeepers so that we're not contradicting ourselves in this free speech and this kind of freedom and this better life? Like you said, that's outside the technical side. Do you have any kind of philosophy on how we do that well, how we govern things well so that we don't fall into the same traps as these kind of web2 tech giants?</p> <p></p> <p>Bin Zhu</p> <p>They have straightforward dimensions that can be put to the test quite simply. To gauge our current standing, consider the hypothetical scenario of shutting down AWS, Google Cloud, or even Azure Cloud. The consequences would be far-reaching. Web3, encompassing social media, decentralized platforms, GameFi, SocialFi, Ethereum, and even wallet services like MetaMask, would cease to exist. It might seem improbable, but it emphasizes that we are not yet firmly entrenched in the web3 world. Presently, web3 relies heavily on the underlying infrastructure of web2. This duality poses both challenges and opportunities.</p> <p>The downside is apparent: the majority of blockchain validators operate on web2 infrastructure. While you may have tokens securely on the blockchain, the validators themselves rely on centralized systems such as AWS or Google. This vulnerability means that if there were any disruption or stringent regulations, the validators could be shut down, introducing risks even to token holders.</p> <p>On the positive side, this realization signifies that we are still in the early stages of the transition. The fact that most web3 is built on web2 infrastructure underscores the opportunity for individuals like you and me to actively contribute to the creation of a decentralized web3. The question then becomes: who will host the servers for web3 infrastructures? The answer is everyone. Individuals in the space, including you and me, have the capability to run servers. In this envisioned decentralized future, components of digital infrastructure\u2014whether it's GameFi, SocialFi, or any other digital asset\u2014could reside on servers in your bedroom or basement. This distributed approach ensures redundancy and resilience; even if one of your nodes goes offline, there's a backup in your neighbor's house.</p> <p>In this decentralized vision, even if public clouds like AWS were to experience downtime, the dApps, blockchains, and socialFi or GameFi platforms would persist. Wallet services would remain accessible. This, in essence, represents the pure decentralized vision of web3. Presently, we may find ourselves in an interim phase, perhaps web2.5, as these applications still leverage tokens, token interactions, and private key management. Yet, the ongoing evolution suggests a trajectory towards a fully decentralized web3 landscape.</p> <p>But unfortunately they're still on web2 infrastructure. So for me, we're not there yet, but we'll try our best to get there eventually.</p> <p></p> <p>BullRingCrypto</p> <p>Yeah, that's amazing. And the way that I'm kind of picturing it in my mind is that we have a very shiny skyscraper. We have this steel and the glass and everything. That's like the kind of, this is our web3 vision that everyone can see. But the foundations are actually firmly rooted in web2, aren't they? That's kind of what's happening in my mind as I'm visualizing what you're saying. We need to actually move the whole building so that the foundations of the infrastructure is actually in the web3 environment and distributed as well. </p> <p>And like you were saying there, when you have kind of individual challenges on your own node, then you have these kind of. I don't know whether I'm using the right language, but maybe like a micro grid that are all interconnected. I mean, I touched on these kind of topics back in 2018 when the narrative was around IoT and I was trying to pitch or piece together in my mind all of these interconnected devices that we were going to have. </p> <p>The fridge being able to speak to the car for a shopping list, for example, what's missing out of the fridge, and the heating that you were going to be able to switch on from the car, and all of these kind of things that we're seeing manifesting now.</p> <p>I was trying to understand that and how that whole network could work, but then also all of those devices contributing to the network itself and being validating the network so it's more secure. Because I think I saw on your documentation about the more powerful the network, you're going to need traffic. So you're going to need a lot of messaging between each of these devices to really get that going. Am I on the right track there or am I kind of off skew?</p> <p></p> <p>Bin Zhu</p> <p>Yes, that's correct. When it comes to Ethereum, or the earlier versions before ETH 2.0, and Bitcoin, the consensus is that more computational power equates to heightened security, minimizing the risk of third-party attacks. Similarly, for Stratos and its proof of traffic mechanism, we favor a scenario where there's a higher volume of traffic circulating in the network. This, in turn, reduces the overall risk to the network. The logic behind this lies in the fact that increased traffic corresponds to more data on the network. As users continually generate, consume, upload, and download content, Stratos gains strength. The heightened activity attracts more participants, leading to increased rewards and higher traffic fees paid by consumers. From a miner's perspective, this is twofold. Firstly, they find it profitable to join Stratos as miners, ensuring they make money and avoid losses. Secondly, recognizing the potential for increased earnings, miners may choose to invest further in the network by adding more nodes, strengthening Stratos even more.</p> <p>They invest in their hardware\u2014be it their bandwidth, CPUs, or disks\u2014to fortify and enhance their ability to provide superior services. In the context of proof of traffic, having hardware alone isn't sufficient; stability is key to reaping substantial rewards. Nodes must be robust, responding promptly to user requests and data demands to ensure a stable and reliable network. Miners, recognizing the importance of this, actively work on strengthening their own servers, contributing to the overall robustness of the Stratos network.</p> <p>Drawing an analogy, it's akin to a nation where all families are strong and healthy, leading to an improved quality of life. Strong families inspire harder work, contributing to the overall strength of the nation. Likewise, in Stratos, as individual nodes become more resilient and efficient, the entire network benefits. It's a symbiotic relationship.</p> <p>Regarding a question I came across in this space, there was an inquiry about the significance of proof of traffic and how it stands against Filecoin's proof of storage. The essence of proof of traffic lies in its algorithm, fostering collaboration between miners and consumers. It differs from Filecoin's proof of storage, as Stratos' approach focuses on the active participation and cooperation between miners and users within the network.</p> <p>The consumers using the Stratos network are the ones who pay for the traffic. Their payments, in turn, are directed to the miners. However, which miner receives these payments depends on the strength and stability of their server. This competition among miners is beneficial, fostering a dynamic where stronger vendors emerge, and weaker ones are compelled to enhance their capabilities. This competition is a vital mechanism driving the growth and strength of the Stratos network.</p> <p>In contrast, Filecoin operates differently. Miners in the Filecoin network can pay for their own services without necessarily involving consumers. Up to this point, the Filecoin network primarily consists of miners paying each other. Miners in Filecoin can independently generate files by running Linux commands to create empty files on their own servers. By storing these files and proving to the network the existence of a significant amount of data, they receive rewards. This approach, however, results in a network where miners are primarily serving themselves and their own needs, without necessarily considering external consumers.</p> <p>In Stratos, miners must provide services that attract external consumers. It's akin to running a restaurant; the food must be delicious to attract customers. If no one orders the food, the restaurant owner doesn't make money. This dynamic ensures that the Stratos proof of traffic model is more robust, healthier, and secure compared to a model focused solely on storage. </p> <p></p> <p>BullRingCrypto</p> <p>Thank you very much indeed. Yeah, and I love the way that you're using analogies there. So that we can understand quite a technical subject. So thank you very much for that Bin. And yeah, thank you for cryptonia two on Twitter that actually put that question to bin. You're one of the winners tonight. So I won't repeat that question at the end of tonight's session because it has been brought up already. So well done to you for bringing up something that's on the forefront of Bin's mind there. </p> <p>Bin, please, can we move into DePIN now? I feel that this is a super strong narrative, because I think, from what I've kind of researched in the past, a lot of web3 is speculation. Speculation. We think that these crypto tokens or coins, they may do something if the narrative picks up, et cetera. And I think there's a lot of that. But also there is an underpinning of this infrastructure you're talking about now, what we need to make changes. </p> <p>And like you said, whether we're at 2.2 or 2.5 or 2.8 on the journey to web3, we could debate that all evening. But I think that what we've got to say to ourselves is that this DePIN narrative, along with probably AI, is going to be, for me, one of the strongest narratives in 2024 25 if we'd see a bull run.</p> <p>I think a lot of the projects are doing and are going to do exceptionally well. Can you first of all, kind of just begin to explain to our listeners DePIN, and some of the different, not necessarily projects, but some of the different areas that will be covered, not just what you're covering yourself at Stratos, please elaborate on that, obviously, but all of the different areas that you can foresee being extremely strong as we move throughout this year.</p> <p></p> <p>Bin Zhu</p> <p>DePIN stands out as a significant narrative in the crypto space. Prior to DePIN, discussions centered around tokens, Defi, GameFi, and SocialFi. However, DePIN introduces a tangible aspect \u2013 physical devices that people can see, touch, and actively participate in by incorporating these devices into their homes, offices, or personal spaces. The range of devices can vary widely, from rooftop 5G setups to solar panels or small plugins for computers.</p> <p>Currently, the DePIN narrative is global, with diverse DePINs emerging daily. These devices serve various purposes, from powering electric cars to enhancing electricity distribution and improving Internet connections. One of the key aspects of DePIN, as highlighted by Helium, is that it's a people network. Unlike the centralized networks created by major cable companies and carriers, DePIN encourages individuals, everyone from you and me to participants worldwide, to contribute to the network. Initially, users may be like leaves on the edge of a big, centralized network branch, but the vision is for the people network to evolve and eventually replace these centralized structures. The aim is for all distributed devices to be contributed by individuals, fostering a fully decentralized network where devices connect to each other.</p> <p>In the context of web2 infrastructure mentioned in previous questions, the focus was on centralized hardware. With DePIN, the idea is to have the hardware of people networks connect to form a robust network. This, in turn, could serve as the foundation for web3 infrastructure, bringing another layer of decentralization. Even traditional connections like cables, fiber optics, and electricity-powered connections could become decentralized. Stratos infrastructure could then be built on top of this decentralized framework. While achieving this grand goal may take time \u2013 perhaps more than a year or a couple of years \u2013 it represents the dream of DePIN projects and the broader community. It's a visionary goal that requires step-by-step progress, with various projects sharing the vision of a decentralized future, making DePIN a significant part of the crypto landscape.</p> <p></p> <p>BullRingCrypto</p> <p>Thank you Bin touching there on this model of all sorts of different devices from something plugging into USB to something wearable, a device in your pocket, a solar panel, our lives, no matter where we are across the earth are all becoming more and more digitalized. So I'm anticipating we're going to see much more of like a circular kind of economy. </p> <p>What I mean by that is we've been farmed for so many years by our governments to be consumers and having the yardstick of GDP as kind of the success of the nations. And we're moving into a kind of a new era, I believe. And that new era is more kind of greener, less consumption. Instead of being farm to consume now we're looking at different areas of our lives and thinking how can we reduce that consumption? So when we reduce the consumption and let's just say we're using one of our devices, I've seen the terminology prosumer. </p> <p>So you are a producer and a consumer yourself. The way I see it in my mind is that that's circular. So I'm producing and consuming, I'm reducing my footprint because I'm contributing on some aspects and then I'm utilizing multiple different platforms to then consume on another side.</p> <p>So I'm producing and then consuming in like I say, this circular system. Do you think that this has then the power? Because I think what we're touching on then of course is social, which we've talked about already, but also kind of this is economics now. And then we also must kind of go into the political side because it's going to have a profound effect on governance and kind of rules, isn't it? The whole set up. </p> <p>So do you also see that it's not just kind of a dream? Because I think most of this, we can conceptualize it so I think we can do it. There's a lot of friction points, I agree. But do you see this as revolutionary in so much as the kind of topics that I've just mentioned in how us humans in the next 20 years are going to be living our lives?</p> <p></p> <p>Bin Zhu</p> <p>Certainly, I understand the sensitivity of the topic. When we delve into the realm of cables, internet connections, and resources controlled by carriers, telecoms, or electricity companies, it becomes a highly sensitive and powerful area managed by governments. The value of DePIN is still relatively new, and regulatory bodies, such as the US SEC, are starting to address tokens and attempt to exert control over aspects they may find challenging. There's a potential for conflict where countries or government entities may attempt to control or influence the development of DePIN, similar to what has been witnessed in the DeFi space.</p> <p>As DePIN grows in size and attracts more participants and powerful entities, such challenges could indeed emerge. For instance, issues related to electricity or internet connections might become contentious points that certain countries or government bodies may seek to control. However, it's important to note that this is speculative and depends on various factors, including how DePIN evolves and the responses it garners from regulatory bodies.</p> <p>Drawing a parallel with data regulation, like GDPR in Europe, there's an acknowledgment of the complexities when dealing with personal data. In the crypto world, identifying where users are located becomes challenging, and complying with geographical data storage regulations could pose significant hurdles for DePIN.</p> <p>While these potential challenges may be on the horizon, the resilience and adaptability of the crypto community often lead to finding innovative solutions. People within the space tend to devise ways to work with governments, organizations, or navigate regulatory landscapes effectively. Overcoming such challenges becomes part of the growth process for DePIN, analogous to the broader evolution seen in the cryptocurrency and decentralized technology space. The path to resolving regulatory concerns and building a stronger foundation may not be straightforward, but the community's ability to address issues and adapt is a key aspect of the continued growth of decentralized projects like DePIN. How to fight against something like regulation, probably out of the topic of today. So I don't want to go deeper about that part.</p> <p></p> <p>BullRingCrypto</p> <p>Yeah, absolutely. Sorry. I was probably borderline there with my sort of questions and probably was quite deep. But what I was trying to do to the listeners is I was trying to show the magnitude of what could potentially unfold in the future. Because I think when we're looking at projects, when we're looking at a narrative, I think it's very good to look at just the sheer magnitude of what we are dealing with. And we haven't even gone deep. </p> <p>I mean, we've just touching on the edge. And we're already dealing with a very deep and sensitive topic that can be completely disruptive to many different areas. And that's kind of what I was trying to allude to in the question. </p> <p>So I'll bring the conversation back because this is about Stratos now. Stratos network went live in September. Talk to me about the network. Talk to me about the interoperability. Give us, the listeners some idea. We're talking about decentralized storage, aren't we? And we're talking about many different use cases, which I'll come on to in a moment, but talk to me about that transition into the mainnet, how that went and how things are actually looking at the moment.</p> <p></p> <p>Bin Zhu</p> <p>Yeah, great, thank you. The Stratos Mainnet was launched in September 2023, and the decentralized storage followed suit 28 days later. Currently, we have over 500 nodes online\u2014precisely 519 nodes, to be exact. These are storage nodes, collectively providing over four petabytes of storage for users to transfer or upload their data onto the storage network.</p> <p>Efficiency is of utmost importance for Stratos. When users engage in file uploads or downloads, they prioritize efficiency, seeking swift processes without unnecessary delays. In our comparisons and benchmark tests with Google Drive, a widely used centralized system, Stratos has demonstrated impressive performance, often matching or even surpassing Google Drive's speed. This is noteworthy because, as you're aware, Google Drive operates within a centralized system where the location of nodes is known, and their code is simpler compared to the intricacies of Stratos.</p> <p>Stratos navigates challenges posed by a decentralized environment where nodes may be offline, fake, or unstable. Leveraging algorithms, we strive to ensure optimal performance, even from decentralized nodes. This focus on efficiency extends to our collaborations with various projects, especially those in the AI space, like Bittensor and AGC. We stress the importance of efficiency, particularly in utilizing GPUs effectively. Waiting for data for 30 minutes would mean wasting the GPU's potential for that duration.</p> <p>The efficiency Stratos offers is particularly beneficial for GPU users. For instance, a user in France uploading files to train an AI model uploads the file in France. Stratos automatically creates four additional copies and distributes them to different global locations. This distribution ensures that GPU users, regardless of their location, can access a copy of the data locally, reducing latency.</p> <p>We term this approach as 'edge storage,' a concept we leverage when working with GPU calculations at the edge. This global distribution of copies helps reduce latency, making Stratos an excellent fit for GPU-related tasks. This capability is attractive to AI projects, showcasing one of the practical use cases of Stratos. </p> <p>Another use case involves a decentralized Dropbox, where a third-party team is currently working on the backend to allow users to upload and download files securely. The advantage is that users don't need to worry about censorship or undergo KYC processes.</p> <p>The third focus is on a CDN layer, allowing users not only to upload images but also videos and audios. Users can directly share videos stored on Stratos without the need for downloading. Currently, our team is concentrating on these three use cases, aiming to deliver some of them by the end of Q1.</p> <p>To summarize, Stratos emphasizes native functionality, including efficiency, full decentralization, security, and no censorship. Users can freely use Stratos without concerns about revealing personal information. Whether it's CDN, Dropbox, or AI data, Stratos is the foundation ensuring security, no censorship, and full ownership of content. These features are embedded at the infrastructure level, not just at the application level.</p> <p></p> <p>BullRingCrypto</p> <p>Thank you, Bin. And I think that actually touches on Skywalker's question, which was also picked as a winner that talks about ensuring the security and privacy of data on the platform. So, Skywalker, well done. You've been picked as well as one of tonight's questions. I am mindful of our time. So we're now approaching the end, which has just flown by. </p> <p>So what I want to do now, Bin, is I just want to pick the final two questions for you to elaborate on a little bit more, rather than my own questioning, because I think what we can do, hopefully, as long as it's okay with Pablo, is to get you on in a few weeks time again, to elaborate on some of the many questions that I've got for you. So we could have like maybe a part two, but let me not digress and come back to the questions here. </p> <p>The Sam crypto, crypto rigger, as you'll handle on Twitter, has asked a question. Stratos needs three node types, meta node, blockchain node and resource node. Can you briefly explain these nodes in sort of a five minute high level overview, please?</p> <p></p> <p>Bin Zhu</p> <p>Yeah, this is a great question, actually. When we talk about decentralization and crypto, people always attempt to navigate the impossible triangle. Right? Because people want efficiency, security, and decentralization simultaneously. It's very challenging. That's why we devised three different nodes with three distinct consensuses to address the impossible triangle one by one. </p> <p>We have three kinds of nodes, first type, we refer to as meta nodes, forming the meta layer for us. These nodes provide the fastest processing, ensuring the majority of traffic actions can be rapidly responded to and managed. Regardless of the number of people or requests, they strive to efficiently handle them. This consensus is conducted at the second level, with meta nodes acting as the primary interface to process swiftly and coordinate effectively. This is the fastest node, aiming to solve the efficiency problem.</p> <p>The second one in the middle is the blockchain node. This node is dedicated to handling Stratos token transactions and data verification. When files are uploaded, each file and its slices hash codes are recorded in our blockchain. So, besides handling token transactions, blockchain nodes play a crucial role in data verification for users uploading and downloading via Stratos. In terms of the impossible triangle, the blockchain node addresses the security concern.</p> <p>The third one, which everyone talks about, is the SDS (Storage and Data Services) node. We actually refer to this as a resource node or resource layer. This layer or node is fully decentralized. Currently, we have 519 nodes online, and all these nodes span the global map, with IPs traced back to more than 20 countries. It operates on a fully decentralized consensus drawn every ten minutes \u2013 a lower frequency due to its fully decentralized nature. While currently focused on providing storage, this layer is flexible, allowing a million resource nodes to participate together. As we progress, users can join as storage nodes or contribute as computing nodes, and later, even as database nodes.</p> <p>This layer is fundamental for us because eventually, all data, computing resources (GPU, CPU), and databases, along with user information, reside in this layer. It may be slower, but it must be fully decentralized. Hence, we have meta nodes, blockchain nodes, and resource nodes. The resource node specifically tackles the decentralization aspect. </p> <p>Our approach involves using three different types of nodes, each corresponding to three different layers and employing three different consensuses to address the triangle of efficiency, security, and decentralization. While it may sound a bit complex, solving this was the first challenge we undertook before building Stratos, recognizing the need for compromise in the absence of a perfect solution. This compromise solution is our best approach to addressing the current challenges of the impossible triangle.</p> <p></p> <p>BullRingCrypto</p> <p>Thank you, Bin. As with the rest of the questions, very insightful and a great question as well. Yeah, I think that understanding those three nodes and understanding how they work in unison is central to understanding Stratos. So thanks. </p> <p>And finally, there's one more question before we wrap up tonight, and that is the question from crypto zero. And this is how does the proof of traffic consensus in the Stratos network contribute to evaluating the valuation of Internet products and ensuring a healthy economic model for decentralized storage networks? So thank you for that, zero. We appreciate the question.</p> <p></p> <p>Bin Zhu</p> <p>Yeah, this is also a great question because right now, most of the time when we talk about technology, we don't discuss economics, but economics is very important when people try to use a product. Because they want to create value with this product, either by making money or saving money. That's economics, a simple way to look at it. So for Stratos, economics is also very important. While everyone understands storage, the crucial part is how storage can generate income. How can we evaluate the value of the data everyone creates? It's a challenging task because the value has many different dimensions. For instance, you create a beautiful picture for your family, sharing a memory that holds immense value for you. However, for strangers who don't know you, the same picture may not hold much value. Thus, estimating the value of data becomes difficult, and that's where economics comes into play. We use traffic.</p> <p>If you check Web2 companies, none of them boast about being the biggest company globally. Instead, most companies focus on metrics like the number of users or active users and the impressions their websites generate \u2014 millions or even billions per day. They care about active users, impressions, and the number of videos watched because these metrics translate into traffic, which can be converted into revenue. They show ads and generate cash flow for the company. In traditional businesses, no one cares about how many debtors you have; they care about traffic. Traffic can generate cash. In Web3, how can we achieve this? Let's revisit Filecoin. Why can Filecoin operate independently? Because miners know that no one cares about the value of what they store. That's why they create garbage data within their own nodes, and no one cares. Still, they earn Filecoin tokens, which they can sell on the market.</p> <p>However, for Stratos, we don't want to encounter the same problem repeatedly. That's why we use traffic. When people pay for storage to store data and want to earn more money, they need to provide valuable information. A great song, a funny short video, or something everyone wants. When they pay for traffic and share their information on Stratos, they know this information must be valuable. Consequently, when it's valuable, others will follow to watch the video, listen to the music, or download the generated file. If nobody is interested in that data, the creator generated traffic but won't pay for that storage fee anymore, and after a few months, say six months, that data will be deleted. The person loses their money, spent it for six months, and earned nothing. That's economics. In this case, we encourage everyone to pay but provide good data.</p> <p>On the internet, we call it hot data. You create high-quality content on Stratos and share it with people. When you create excellent content, others may watch it thousands or even hundreds of thousands of times. Many people may want to download the content or game you've created to play locally. That's fine. When others download and pay for it, you get a portion of that traffic. In this scenario, traffic becomes the real metric to estimate the value of the content. That's economics. When we designed it, Proof of Traffic wasn't just the best way to secure the network; we also saw it as a suitable economic method to increase the value of the Stratos network. It allows everyone, not just the content creators but also the network participants, to find it profitable. If they can make money, they want to stay on it. When they feel they can make money, more content creators will join because, once again, they don't worry about losing ownership of their content to larger platforms. They don't worry about getting their content banned or deleted if someone dislikes it. Again, that's economics. We put a lot of thought into this before creating Stratos, making sure that the cash flow aligns with network security. Yeah.</p> <p></p> <p>BullRingCrypto</p> <p>Thank you, Bin. Yeah, Ciro, that was a great question. I think that gives us a good insight into the economics. I know I touched on earlier on in the X space that it's important for me to try and understand also how sustainable the The economic side is as much as when we talk about green networks and that thing. Like I said, there's a whole heap of content and questions that I've put together that I haven't got round to asking you yet. I would say that it would be wonderful if we could do something again in maybe a month or two's time with Pablo to really look at some other things because we've not looked at the different methods of generating or utilizing the STOS token that you have, some of the use cases and examples of those. Some of you've touched on there a couple, but maybe we can go into depth a little bit more on some of the others. Some more general talk about how things are proceeding for you. We have got run over the hour that we attribute to this. I thank everyone for listening in and investing your time into us.</p> <p>I hope it has been an insightful evening, and I hope that you have gleaned a lot from Bin's very thoughtful, well-put-together answers to the questions that we've given. Well done to the four winners for your questions. Those have been picked by Bin, not myself or CoinMarketLeague. He's actually identified those great questions and picked out the winners. Well done for that. We are at an end. I just want to say thank you to Pablo for hosting these amazing Speculate X podcast on a Sunday evening with some amazing guests that we've had now. </p> <p>Also a huge thank you to Bin for everything that you've delivered for us this evening. Like I said, I think we've only scratch the surface, really, on Stratos because there's that much that I've got here on the website in front of me and in my notepad that we haven't touched on. If you got any final words for our listeners tonight, Bin, before we knock it on the head?</p> <p></p> <p>Bin Zhu</p> <p>Yeah, it's my honor. Thank you, everyone. I apologize for being unwell in the past week, and I'm still dealing with a cough. That's why you may hear me coughing. Anyway, thank you, everyone. A big thanks to the Stratos communities. Without your support, Stratos wouldn't have been voted as the top storage solution. I truly appreciate it. Perhaps in the future, we can organize more spaces to discuss in-depth topics, Stratos updates, and new use cases, maintaining transparency in the Stratos team and processes. Yeah, thank you.</p> <p></p> <p>BullRingCrypto</p> <p>Thank you very much, Bin. Thank you, all listeners. It's been another wonderful evening. I've really enjoyed it. It can catch it on record. If you're listening on record, thank you also for tuning in. Until next Sunday, next Sunday evening, we're going to be having another exciting guest, which we'll publish sometime in the week. Take care, everyone. Have a great week, and I look forward to speaking to you then. Cheers, bye-bye.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"bin-zhu-quickswap-space/","title":"Bin Zhu speaks about Stratos on QuickSwap X Space, January 12th, 2024","text":"<p>[Click] to listen. (Starts at 2:13:50).</p> <p></p> <p>Host</p> <p>Bin Zhu, if we could have you introduce yourself.</p> <p>Bin Zhu</p> <p>Thank you. My name is Bin Zhu. I'm the founder of Stratos. I'm very happy to have heard a lot of talk about the storage, mainly about the performance and about the CDN. We just talked about that, actually. That's what Stratos already accomplished.</p> <p>Host</p> <p>Bin is the one that, guys, I mentioned. I was asking a question on a random thread about DePIN, and he was actually the one who answered it. So good to have you.</p> <p>Bin Zhu</p> <p>Thank you. Stratos was started in 2021. Actually, before, I worked for the web2, for almost 20 years. I fully understand how web2 works. And when I started Stratos, I realized, oh, web2 is so powerful because it has a very strong backbone. It's the cloud. </p> <p>But web3 doesn't have that. They only have blockchain. Blockchain is a decentralized ledger that is powerful, but they cannot do everything. That's why we decided to create Stratos. </p> <p>At Stratos, we started to deliver the storage. After that, we will start working on the computation this year, and then we will work on the database. The same thing as the centralized cloud. </p> <p>People always need to find a way to store something like video, like image, like NFT, or a document. When you save your data, then you will realize, oh, I have my video,  I need to stream that. Or maybe I need to encode my video. Maybe I need to process my picture. This is what the second requirement is: I want to process. Okay. </p> <p>Then the Computation is doing that work. After the computation, they will get some clean data, structured data. Where will they save it? They will save it to the database. That's why Stratos milestones are storage, computation, and database. We will solve the problem step by step. That's what we do. That's what Stratos does. </p> <p>Then the people will talk about the performance. People always talk like: Yeah. Decentralized storage will probably never compete with centralized storage, but fortunately, we did some benchmarks on Stratos. </p> <p>Stratos main network, just launched in September 2023, actually three, four months ago. But right now we already have more than 500 nodes across 20 countries. And right now the total storage capacity is more than four petabytes. </p> <p>And we did some benchmarks. We compare it with Google Drive. Everyone uses Google Drive, so we compare it with Google Drive. Our performance, it doesn't matter if it\u2019s downloading or uploading, our performance was always compatible with them, sometimes even faster than them. </p> <p>Also recently we cooperate with several AI projects. The reason they want to work with us, because Stratos really provides a decent, efficient storage solution for them. The main reason is the edge. I really like the edge, because when we talk about the decentralized, we don't talk the edge, but edge is very important. Edge computing, edge storage. The AI project, they provide the GPUs. They wanted the GPU to feed the data and train the AI model.</p> <p>But the GPU could be located anywhere because it's a decentralized network. It could be in the US, Europe, or maybe Asia. But where the data comes from, they're not sure. That's why most of the time the GPU is waiting for the data to trend. So most of the time, GPUs have nothing to do. </p> <p>But Stratos is purely decentralized. It's all in the edge with the GPUs. So the GPU will be much more efficient to get the data from Stratos. So that's why they like to cooperate with us. Okay, that's one use case. Actually, we're working now and we already have several partners with us. </p> <p>The other use case we're doing right now with third party is called decentralized Dropbox. The people, they don't trust the Google Drive or Apple iCloud, because of the censorship. Some people really want to use some secure platform. But the public cloud, they always have censorship or other regulations. So we are working on the decentralized Dropbox. So when you have your own decentralized Dropbox, you don't worry about your content anymore. You don't worry that they will scan your data, they will scan your image. </p> <p>No, you don't have to worry that they will delete or block your account. No, because you have your own key. As long as you have your own key, you will always be the owner of your content. As they say, not your key, not your crypto. From our side, we say, not your key, not your content. That's the second use case. </p> <p>The third one is CDN. We just mentioned the CDN, decentralized CDN. Actually Stratos is working on that. We will deliver the decentralized CDN very soon. How will that work? People can just upload video or audio on the Stratos network, because the performance of the network is good. So people don't need to download the video or the audio before they play it. They can directly stream it like TikTok or YouTube does. </p> <p>So yeah, that is already accomplished. And we will start working, looking for more partners and work together with them. We want to show the world how decentralized storage, how decentralized computation can change the way people work. And we also want people, not only crypto community, also the traditional world, traditional industry to learn about this. </p> <p>Some people are saying, okay, it\u2019s very hard  for traditional businesses to adapt to the crypto world. But I talked to some business, I talked to some friends, they didn\u2019t say that they don't like crypto. They like it, but they really don't have some very useful infrastructure they can use.</p> <p>They lack no censorship, they lack the ability to control the content by themselves. They just didn't find a good one to use in this case. </p> <p>Actually we had a conversation a long time ago with a big company in the UK. They always save their data on AWS, but they're storing personal, very personal data. They don't like to take that responsibility. Because, the public cloud, sometimes they have issues, maye sometimes they will leak data. So they talked with us. They asked if we could work with them and store their personal, very personal information on Stratos as well. And right now we still have conversations with them. One day when Stratos network will be bigger. Now we have 500 nodes, maybe when we have 1000 nodes, 2000 nodes, we probably could talk with them again to say, okay, now we are ready to take your data.</p> <p>Host</p> <p>Sounds like you guys are doing a lot there. Um, I appreciate the explanation about what Stratos is doing, where you guys have come, everything you have built.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"howto-install-stratos-full-chain-validator-node/","title":"Setup a Full-Chain Node","text":"<p> Last update: September 21, 2023</p>"},{"location":"howto-install-stratos-full-chain-validator-node/#requirements","title":"Requirements","text":"<ul> <li>A working Ubuntu 18.04+ installation with SSH access</li> <li>Decent hardware: 8 cores, 2.5GHz / core, 32 GB RAM, 2 TB free space available.</li> <li>Low latency and decent speed bandwidth: anything wired with 10MBps or higher.

Like miners on proof-of-work, validators are responsible for processing transactions on Stratos Network and, by doing so, helping secure the network. </p> <p>In return, they receive an incentive for their participation, in the form of STOS coins.</p> What is a delegation? <p>Delegation refers to the process of entrusting (also known as 'staking') your STOS coins to a validator on a Stratos blockchain, which works under a Proof-of-Stake algorithm. </p> <p>In PoS networks, validators are responsible for creating new blocks and validating transactions, and they are chosen based on the number of coins they hold as collateral. </p> <p>Delegation allows cryptocurrency holders, who may not have the technical expertise or the desire to become validators themselves, to participate in network consensus and earn rewards by lending their coins to validators.</p> Why should you delegate? <ul> <li> <p>Passive income: If you plan to hold on STOS for a while, you can accumulate more coins by staking them.</p> </li> <li> <p>Support Network Security: Validators play a crucial role in maintaining the security and integrity of PoS blockchain networks. By delegating your coins to a validator, you contribute to the network's overall security.</p> </li> <li> <p>No Technical Expertise Required: Delegating doesn't require you to run complex server setups or maintain technical infrastructure, as validators do. It's a straightforward process that allows you to participate in network consensus without the need for specialized knowledge.</p> </li> </ul> What are the risks of delegating? <ul> <li> <p>Slashing: Validators and delegators in PoS networks can face slashing penalties if they act maliciously or negligently. Slashing involves the loss of a portion of your staked coins as a penalty. This can happen if a validator produces invalid blocks, double signs, or violates network rules. Delegators who have delegated their coins to a validator that gets slashed may also suffer losses.</p> </li> <li> <p>Validator Downtime: Validators are responsible for maintaining an always-on infrastructure. If your chosen validator experiences frequent downtime or disruptions, it can impact your staking rewards. Validators that fail to produce blocks consistently may result in missed reward opportunities for delegators.</p> </li> <li> <p>Market Volatility: The value of the cryptocurrency you stake can fluctuate significantly in the market. If the price of the staked cryptocurrency falls, it may offset the staking rewards you earn, and you could end up with fewer assets than you initially staked.</p> </li> <li> <p>Validator Reputation: Choosing a reputable validator is crucial. If you delegate your coins to a validator with a poor track record or one that behaves maliciously, you risk losing staking rewards and even part of your staked coins through slashing.</p> </li> </ul> How is 0xDevRawl mitigating slashing risks? <p>There are two major slashing risks:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Double-signing: Signing two or more blocks at the same height. This usually doesn't happen by accident, but rather by malicious intent. I am staking my own coins to this validator so I have no reason to put them at risk.</p> </li> <li> <p>Downtime: Offline time / absence to sign transactions. The server running this validator is behind two redundant UPSs which can provide around 60 minutes of run time in case of a power outage. Server also has two dedicated 1Gbps internet connections (one is used as back-up in case the other goes down). There is no guarantee the validator won't ever have downtime, but the risk is minimal. Moreover, the slashing penalty for downtime is very low (around 0.002%).</p> </li> </ul> Can your delegated coins be moved? <p>No. Coins ownership remains with the delegator. When you stake your coins in a PoS network, you're essentially locking them up as collateral to participate in network consensus and earn rewards. However, you don't lose ownership of these coins; they still belong to you, and you retain control over them.</p> Can you undelegate / redelegate? <p>Sure. If you want to change validators, you can redelegate your coins to a different validator, with 0 lock-up time. You can also undelegate and get the coins back into your wallet but there's a 21 days lock-up period for that action.</p>"},{"location":"staking/#how-to-stake","title":"How to stake","text":""},{"location":"start/","title":"Welcome","text":"<p>About this page</p> <ul> <li>This is a community operated website and it\u2019s not, in any way, endorsed by the official Stratos project.</li> <li>The content on this website is written from a node operator experience and it's intended to help other node operators in their journey.</li> <li>For any questions, you can find me on the official Discord or Telegram.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"start/#quick-start","title":"Quick Start","text":"Description Link What types of nodes can I run on Stratos Network?

I'm your host, Claire, and very thrilled to be here with all of you today. I suggest we just wait for another one minute or so, and then we'll be ready to jump right into all the questions and everything. If you're not able to be up here, ask questions, you can also leave your questions under this Twitter space, so we'll be able to check that and potentially have it answered as well. Thank you all.</p> <p>Claire</p> <p>Right, it's 12.05. I think we're ready to kick start this. Welcome again. Whether you are a long term Stratos supporter or you just recently discovered Stratos decentralized storage, or you're super into it. We're really happy to have you here today with us for this Monthly Community AMA. And we hope that we are able to answer all of your burning or challenging questions today. So as usual, our co-founder Bin Zhu is here with us and is ready to have a great discussion with all of our community members. So if you have been following Stratos and our journey for quite a while, you know that our team has been super dedicated in terms of developing the first fully decentralized storage, and we're actually very close towards the Stratos Chain and also Stratos decentralized storage, mainnet launch. Over the past two months, we've also announced some great news. For example, we officially closed the test net versions, but at the same time, we launched another Mesos test net which will be ongoing even when the mainnet launch is ready. At the same time, we also have the EXOSwap bridge, which is ready to allow interoperability to all the EVM compatible blockchains.</p> <p>Claire</p> <p>So in today's AMA, we are ready to just answer some of the questions from our community, whether it's regarding the technical development, future marketing plans, or maybe plans in regards to mainnet launch. So now, without further ado, we actually just would like to have community members, you can raise your mic. I will pull up here and Bin and myself will be able to answer all your questions directly. You can feel free to raise your mic. Also, I want to make sure everyone can hear me clearly.</p> <p>Bin</p> <p>Yeah, I can hear you clearly.</p>"},{"location":"stratos-ama-twitter-spaces-03-08-2023/#exchange-listings","title":"Exchange Listings","text":"<p>Claire</p> <p>Well, we're ready for all the burning questions. Usually, people are always very enthusiastic about asking questions, even though our team has been trying to keep it very transparent with every step towards the mainnet launch. But I think maybe because I saw many people asking about the news on exchange listing, maybe you can start with this one. And at the same time, I think our admins can help us pull some questions that maybe people posted in our Telegram chat.</p> <p>Bin</p> <p>Okay, sure. Actually, recently, there are several layer 2 exchanges that talk to us. Layer 2 exchanges, their ranking number is between 10 to 30, around. We also discuss with them about to integrate not only with the ERC 20 tokens, the STOS token, also integrate with our native tokens. And they said they can do it. We think we will have more listing coming after the mainnet, not before mainnet because for the new exchange, there are not much liquidities. So right now, we are talking to the gate and the gate side, they will integrate our native tokens after the mainnet is launched. So that's one. Then we will start to listing our tokens on more exchanges. But I know community really hope we can listing our token Binance, OKAX or other layer 1 exchanges I think from my point of view, I think it's coming. Just waiting for the mainnet is launched and to see how the mainnet is going and more and more people know us and more trade in volume is increased and we will have more opportunity to list down on them.</p>"},{"location":"stratos-ama-twitter-spaces-03-08-2023/#validators","title":"Validators","text":"<p>Claire</p> <p>Thank you. So that has been answered. I do have some questions, a long list, so I'll maybe just start by raising those questions and you can answer it since no one is really raising hand at the moment. So we have a question in regards validators participation. So how many professional validators will be joining Stratos mainnet? Because people are seeing that at a moment there may be less than 10 active validators on Mesos testnet.</p> <p>Bin</p> <p>Yeah, there are not much on Mesos because Mesos have no any reward and no any incentive. I understand that. Mostly just for testing purpose. But right now, you guys know we already launched the validator program and actually we have more than 10 validator provider.  They will participate us when the mainnet is launched. And then later on, probably, and also we talked to some top validators and they said they would like to see how it's going, how your mainnet is going. Then they will decide after the mainnet is launched. So for now, we will have more than 10 validator provider participate when the mainnet is launched and the more validator provider will come after that.</p>"},{"location":"stratos-ama-twitter-spaces-03-08-2023/#challenges","title":"Challenges","text":"<p>Claire</p> <p>Perfect. We'll just wait for the main event launch and to see the rest of professional validators joining the network, basically. We have also another question is, what are the main obstacles or challenges that you think the current testnet or current development are experiencing in terms of our project?</p> <p>Bin</p> <p>Actually, I feel the challenge is not the technical slide for now, since we're almost there to deliver the mainnet. Actually, the challenge is how people think about that, how people think about crypto, how people think about the Web3 or decentralized services, in general. That's a hard challenge for me. For example, when our team went to the ETH Denver, I went to some conference, and even when I went to Hong Kong Web3 Festival, we talked about some projects and some GameFi, SocialFi, and other projects. Even we talk to SUI. We talked about that in the community before. But when we really match them, when we really do the demos, they say, Oh, this is amazing, the performance, everything's good. But it's very hard to see motivation from a lot of projects. They see there is a decentralized project, but when we want to provide decentralized storage, they feel, okay, I'm very fine with AWS or Google storage or others. I didn't see any motivation from them. They feel okay because their community doesn't care. Their investor doesn't care. They don't care about what's really decentralized about their company. They seemed more interested in our token price.</p> <p>Bin</p> <p>I understand a lot of people, they jump to this industry. It's not only talk about the decentralized freedom or ownership, they more care about the price of the token. How can they make money? Actually, I feel this is the challenge in the future. And after mainnet has launched, how can we prove them and convince them about our project? They feel very comfortable with the centralized system. They even don't want to move to the decentralized system, maybe because they feel it can be more complicated since they're using Google AWS. We feel we need to plan the strategy. One, probably the price will be cheaper (to use our storage compared to centralized storage cost). The other one, if the centralized system, they do something bad for your project, probably you will have a very bad nightmare. So you will trust the decentralized more than the centralized. That's the challenge for me and for the team. We will not only fight centralized system by ourselves, we really want for other projects also believing in decentralized when they deliver something in the crypto world. That's the challenge for us. It's not the technical challenges.</p>"},{"location":"stratos-ama-twitter-spaces-03-08-2023/#mainnet-and-marketing","title":"Mainnet and Marketing","text":"<p>Claire</p> <p>Thanks, Bin, for sharing some very brutal realities and also some genuine feedback from talking with other projects and the industries. I think what we're really lacking is the recognition of this real problem or the need for infrastructures from the general stakeholders for this whole industry. And it's definitely a long journey for us to continue in working on educating and bring more awareness to that. Next question. So it's also related to the main net launch. So have you confirmed the main net time? Do you have a marketing plan when we'll start? Are there any partners joining? It's a big question and you can choose which one to start your answer with.</p> <p>Bin</p> <p>Yeah, we will launch the mainnet, we talk about this soon so often. It's coming. We will announce the mainnet launch date in Toronto. In that conference in our builder room, we will tell everyone exactly the date we will launch the mainnet. Just not today, we will announce it at that conference. Also, we will announce that in Twitter as well. Just wait a little bit longer. The conference in Toronto will be on August 15th. We will announce that date as August 15th. And for the marketing, I understand that people, our community, sometimes they complain about the marketing. Actually, this morning and the recent couple of days, Claire, me and our team, we talked about the marketing a lot. And when we launch, the marketing plan we have will be accelerated. Now, we're continuing to plan it, but when we close and close to the launch date, you will see how the marketing plan, and we will also announce the bounty program. And if someone is interested to participate with our ecosystem,  we will have a grant for the third party developers, communities to build something with us together. There are several programs we will announce at the same time. It's all coming.</p> <p>Claire</p> <p>I can also elaborate a little bit more in terms of the marketing plans. Basically, the whole marketing plan building post main network are targeted for two major audience. The first first is the general crypto enthusiast. Besides the traditional YouTube type of educational videos, we are also trying to focus the efforts on more short TikTok or also short Reels, those type of fast promoting content. And at the same time, we're also outreaching for some alliance or public figures on Twitter as well to help us raising more awareness. At the same time, events is also one of our major tools in terms of continuing helping us to build the developer communities. At the same time, another audience would be really developers, tech savvy people, or techies in general. The Toronto conference, Bin just mentioned, is one of a kick off event or the first builder house that we will be doing to get our name up, all the developers, not only based in Toronto, but mostly who will be there attending the ETH Toronto at the same time. Following that, we will be also checking different events around the world, just trying to prioritize our time and energie to focus on a few regions and supporting those developers with certain grants program, which will also be announced later on as well.</p> <p>Claire</p> <p>This is how we see Stratos marketing should be done in such a way together. But yeah, on top of that, I still need to mention how we still really encourage communities to be creative or are still trying to promote us in different ways to share knowledge. So your participation is also very important for us to build a stronger community together. But yeah, that'll be all for the quick marketing plan for now. I saw that Johnny requested to speak early on. Johnny, please go ahead with your question.</p> <p>Speaker</p> <p>Hello, everybody. I have a question regarding the mainnet, et cetera. I know we are now in a bear market. You hear a lot of FUD in the market and it's still not sure what we are thinking about is coming Bitcoin after the halving is it going to make a huge jump or is it staying the same? Are you depending also on the market a little bit with the main net or are you saying when the main net is ready, we're going to launch, we're going to make the marketing plan and we're going to go ahead with what we are planning to do?</p> <p>Bin</p> <p>Yeah, this is a very good question. We hope we can launch the mainnet when everything's good. We don't want to say that something bad or something is crashing. Even if some crashing (in crypto market price) happens, we will still launch the mainnet. But we did see some bad things happening last year, for example LUNA or FTX. So if everything will be like right now in the market, we will announce the date in the Toronto conference and once the date it announced, we won't change it unless some huge damage is coming. But otherwise, we will continue to follow our plan step by step. That's one. The other thing, I don't know. Maybe Bitcoin will crash next month. I don't know about either way. Our project is not like the public chain project. It's really driven by the usage. It's really driven by how many projects, how many developers, or how many users are using our storage because we really generate some real value. It's not to generate some fake stuff. We really generate real value to bring to the people, bring to their business. So we will see. We will be very excited to do it. Even after the mainnet launch, we will be very careful to stick to the plan but also have a backup plan.</p> <p>Speaker</p> <p>Okay, I understand. Can I have another question? Sure. Yes. Regarding the marketing, I heard just before, just a few things, but is there a master plan? Is there something like, Okay, we're going to do that and that and these steps. How are we going to get involved in a bigger... I'm on Telegram every day. I like to speak in the community. I think we have a great community in the Stratos Telegram. But is there a way that you you guys or your organization say, Okay, we're going to do this step. It's really important. Then it's going to be the next step. That's what I want to ask.</p> <p>Claire</p> <p>I can take this question. So I think the right marketing should be always dynamic related to our major milestone. And I also think that, of course, we do have a master plan, we do have budget, we want to allocate the resources and everything. I think if you are mentioning that how maybe you as a community member, you can try to support. We also do have the ambassador program, the one we rolled out last year. But if you are interested maybe to join as an ambassador and trying to maybe contribute more, just rather than the community member, we're also happy to talk about that too. But to answer your questions, yes, we have a very specific plan, and the plan is always surrounding to making sure our mainnet launch or product launch or major timeline can be successful.</p> <p>Speaker</p> <p>Okay, thank you. Okay, thanks.</p>"},{"location":"stratos-ama-twitter-spaces-03-08-2023/#whats-different-about-stratos","title":"What's Different about Stratos","text":"<p>Claire</p> <p>Okay, we also have user Jim as speaker. You can also feel free to unmute yourself and ask questions if you have.</p> <p>Speaker</p> <p>Hello, yeah, I'm happy to be here. Can you hear me?</p> <p>Claire</p> <p>I can hear you. Yes. And also, Johnny, can I ask you maybe to mute yourself if you're not speaking or asking questions at the moment? Thank you. Jim, please go ahead.</p> <p>Speaker</p> <p>I'm just curious, what's the difference between... What's it exactly going to offer for new people? I know it's decentralized storage, but what else is going to drive people to come along? Because I remember you related to AI and Filecoin. What difference are we to them?</p> <p>Bin</p> <p>Okay. Mainly you want to know what stratos can provide compared with other decentralized storage solutions. You talk about the Filecoin or even AR or the others. I think the major difference is Stratos can provide very high performance uploading, downloading. Later on, also for the streaming, decentralized solution then Filecoin and AR. In this case, Stratos is suitable for AI training to saving their data for training, for process. The other thing is like the CDN, the hot data, the short video, or the music. That's the major difference between us and others. Because we're using a different structure architecture, we have three layers, the meta layer, the resource layer and the blockchain. We try to break the impossible triangle to solve the decentralization and the high performance. So it's just one sentence to say that major difference, better performance, more stable, and will be more suitable to serving the hot data in the internet.</p> <p>Speaker</p> <p>Okay, that sounds good. So we'll have literally the same as them and we'll be able to store NFTs and stuff like that.</p> <p>Bin</p> <p>Yeah, exactly. We can store the NFT, it's not only image. Some NFT, they are videos, they maybe be audios, or they may be have that big banner file. Sure, we can save them. Actually, NFT is one of the projects we want to collaborate very close. We talked to some NFT project and the NFT market project. We want to provide a very unique service to them because right now, actually, most of the NFT they are using AWS or Google Cloud or some Google CDN services. We really want to convert them to using Stratos as the storage solution.</p> <p>Speaker</p> <p>I'm very surprised that Binance and Coinbase Ventures have not approached you. They're not invested into the company.</p> <p>Bin</p> <p>When we talk about Binance, we know that Binance has announced the greenfield project a couple of months ago, but yeah, maybe in the future. Right now, we don't have any connections with them, but in the future, when we show how powerful the Stratos Mainnet and Stratos Decentralized storage, probably we will talk about the cooperations. Yeah, we will see.</p> <p>Speaker</p> <p>I'm very excited and you've put my mind at rest. I believe you're going to do well, Bin. Thank you.</p>"},{"location":"stratos-ama-twitter-spaces-03-08-2023/#partnerships","title":"Partnerships","text":"<p>Claire</p> <p>No problem. Appreciate your questions. And if you are curious to learn more about the Stratos differences compared to other storage projects, I do believe that we do have a lot of certain discussions and Bin answered a lot of questions similar in our Telegram chat. So maybe you can take a look and find back the chat history back in there. So now I will move to the next questions from community. I think this can be categorized mostly in regards of partnerships. So are we in talks with projects or companies about a cooperation after the mainnet launch? And also people are commonly asking that how do we plan to work on building new partnerships or for business to use our services?</p> <p>Bin</p> <p>Yeah, this is a big question.  So we already created some partnership before the mainnet launch, and that's the one we are going to go back to talk to them. And we will talk with them, invite them to try our Mesos and even the mainnet directly. They are already active partnerships. That's one. The other partnerships actually we are talking, on the site, to some traditional businesses and they are very interested for them to save money and also for the privacy we can bring to them and some ownership if they are interested as well. But this is the traditional business, they won't have any movement until our product is fully ready. That's why we keep this partners on hold until the mainnet is launched. Part of our team will support them, like a customer service support, help them to try, give them some time to have their tests. When they feel satisfied with our product, when they really start to use it, then they will give us permission to announce the partnership. So that's why we cannot give you any details for now. For the new partnerships, especially for the traditional business partners. We cannot say anything for now.</p> <p>Speaker</p> <p>Okay, thank you. Can I just ask one last question? Sorry to interrupt. Sure. I just want to say I'm very happy that you said when you're going to give a date on the mainnet launch and you're going to stick to it, I like that because it's more clear for us investors. Thank you.</p>"},{"location":"stratos-ama-twitter-spaces-03-08-2023/#integration-with-other-blockchains","title":"Integration with other Blockchains","text":"<p>Claire</p> <p>Okay, so let's continue with other questions. What are our plans to integrate with other blockchain projects? I'm assuming that people are maybe asking about other chains, not just regular dApps projects.</p> <p>Bin</p> <p>Yeah, I think it's the public chain. Right now, with our Mesos, we already launched the swap, the bridge. Some of our community members already tested with our test network, with the Ethereum test network, it worked. Later on, we will be working with the third party bridge as well to have the bridge, maybe with other public chain. The reason we want to create the bridge between the different other public chains, the reason is we talk about the cross chain. We want Stratos to be a cross chain project. Cross chain project is not you have your NFT, you have your any digital file could cross chain. The cross chain is for projects on other chains, they need the storage. When they implement their decentralized application, they need the storage service. How will they do? Right now they need to purchase the Filecoin, they need to have AR or other coins, then they pay for that. Okay, if we're using as example, Polkadot. You don't need to convert the dot coin to Stratos.</p> <p>Bin</p> <p>You can directly use your dot coin to pay for the ozone. If you have Solana Sol, you don't need to convert. You can use Sol directly to pay for ozone. So for their ecosystem, we give them less limitations. They can directly use their native token to purchase or to pay for Stratos storage services. That's what we call cross the chain. So when we support more and more public chain, we allow more and more different ecosystems to use Stratos directly right away. That's why we want to cross chain. That's why we will corporate with multiple public chain. But which one we'll start? We start with Ethereum first. After we will go the second one, third one, and then the one, depending on which ecosystem, probably is bigger and have more community, have more developers working on that. We will use based on that dimension to make our priority list and to do it one by one. </p>"},{"location":"stratos-ama-twitter-spaces-03-08-2023/#team-and-foundation-tokens","title":"Team and Foundation Tokens","text":"<p>Claire</p> <p>Thank you for explaining this. I do have another question that maybe I think the community would appreciate the team addressing this. What's the team's plan in terms of selling tokens? Very direct questions, but I'm sure you have the answer.</p> <p>Bin</p> <p>Yeah, actually, we have very transparent information. Everyone can see our wallet in the ETH scan. Everything is on the chair. Later on, we will move most of the tokens to our native chain. There are three parts of the tokens that will be managed by us. Team token, for sure. We will unlock some team tokens when the mainnet is launched for team members. We didn't unlock a single token for the team up to now, we will start to unlock some tokens after mainnet launch. And when we unlock some tokens for the team members, if they want to hold, they want stake, or they want to sell, it's up to them. So I don't know. Okay, that's the second part, the foundations. We also have part of the foundation tokens. And when the mainnet is launched, soon we will open the new round of funding with some investor who is interested in us. That's the one way probably we will sell the token. But if some investor invest with us, we give them the tokens and get the investment, they always on a vesting term.</p> <p>Bin</p> <p>They will not be able to sell huge amount of the tokens right away. No, they will have plans, maybe one year, maybe two year. That's one. The third one is partnership tokens. We will have a grant for anyone that participates with our ecosystem team to build dAPP on Stratos storage. That's the grant. With that grant, we will negotiate with any project, third party to get the grant. We will give them plan: how many tokens you get at start and how many tokens you get when you reach the goal. That's for the third party. How will we sell the token? I think that question is answered, but we will sell token for sure because the foundation, we need money to continue to support the team, to support the ecosystem, keeping going. But we will have a plan and we will announce it and we will continue to keep as transparent as possible to everyone. Yeah. Thank you.</p>"},{"location":"stratos-ama-twitter-spaces-03-08-2023/#liquidity-increase","title":"Liquidity increase","text":"<p>Claire</p> <p>Well, thanks, Bin, for these very honest answers. I'm sure that the community will really appreciate the way you're answering this. So next, question is about, what is the plan to increase liquidity of Stratos on exchanges?</p> <p>Bin</p> <p>Yeah. Yes, right now, our major trading exchange is Gate. I think that is not good at all. Okay. And also MEXC. And later on, we will list our token in more exchanges. The other part is Uniswap. Yeah, we will talk to our market maker and we will increase the ETH, USDT, USDC and STOS. We will increase that pool to make the pool deeper to improve the liquidity after the mainnet is launched. We also negotiate with market makers or even cooperate with more market makers. Right now, we only have one market maker or maybe we also could partner up with more market makers to make the liquidity better. That's one step in our big plan. We will do it after the mainnet launch.</p>"},{"location":"stratos-ama-twitter-spaces-03-08-2023/#timeframe-for-computation-and-database","title":"Timeframe for Computation and Database","text":"<p>Claire</p> <p>Great. Thank you. The next quick question is coming back to the development part. How do you think in terms of the time frame that would take for rolling out computation and database parts? Now that we have the storage almost ready.</p> <p>Bin</p> <p>Yeah. Actually, after the mainnet launch, our team still has a lot of tickets in our system backlog. I will separate the team into three parts. For sure, we will continue to work on the system with one part. We will cooperate with any partner. They do the integration or build something on top of the Stratos, we will support them. The second part, based on the storage solution, we will also build it. We will build the layer also build some dAPP or top layer on Stratos. For example, we will build the CDN layer. People want to use the Stratos to watch videos, to listen to music, or others, or short video. We will build that layer. And if we have a partner that is looking for something like Dropbox, decentralized Dropbox or Google Drive, we encourage them so they build it not ourselves. We can support them. That dAPP can be available later for anyone else as well. So people can feel comfortable to use the decentralized solution of the decentralized version of the Dropbox or Google Drive. The third one, and we will start to build our computing component.</p> <p>Bin</p> <p>We get some data, we also have some ideas. We are using GPU or CPU that one, we will think about that. But based on the information we already have, based on the data, client's data we already got from our SDS, we will start to build the computing components. Then when the computing component is ready, then we will start to work on the database component. There still have very massive tasks we need to accomplish. For some projects, when mainnet launches, it means most of the development is probably done. But for Stratos, the mainnet launch, is just another starting point for us to build more stuff. </p>"},{"location":"stratos-ama-twitter-spaces-03-08-2023/#payment-mechanism-for-storage-services","title":"Payment Mechanism for Storage Services","text":"<p>Claire</p> <p>Yeah, thank you. The other question would be have we come up with a mechanism of how customers can pay for data storage, for example, USD, stos, crypto, and how is that translating to adding value to Stats token? Yeah. I think. It's a question about a payment.</p> <p>Bin</p> <p>Yeah, for the payment. I think payment, there are two. One is payment based on the token, the other payment based on the fiat. But based on the token, if someone want to use a different token to pay for our services, that's why we have the bridge. And we also cooperate with the third party bridge to do it. If they want to pay for the service based on different token on the different public chain. Regarding payments based on field, we don't have an in-house solution, but we could work with some credit card operator, with Crypto com, or even with banks. We talked with L bank, they can also issue their credit cards as well. And some third party they said they have some solutions to convert from USD to USDC, USDT then to STOS. Probably we will be using the third party solutions for the payment as well. That will be very important for us when we cooperate with the traditional business or with some traditional clients. If some clients have no idea what is crypto but they still want to use decentralized Dropbox or decentralized Drive for their own data. So for the Fiat, we will cooperate with third party.</p>"},{"location":"stratos-ama-twitter-spaces-03-08-2023/#cross-chain-compatibility","title":"Cross-Chain Compatibility","text":"<p>Claire</p> <p>Sure. Another question I can still maybe see here, it would be, will Stratos  be available for other projects which are built on other chains like Ethereum or BNB and so on. It's really about cross chain compatibility.</p> <p>Bin</p> <p>Again, sorry, cross chain is not like others. Cross chain is for the payment and the ozone, we call OZ or someone like to call gas fee. That's that one is cross chain. And it doesn't matter if some application, decentralized application, dAPP, they have their dAPP cross the chain. But it doesn't matter on which chain, when they need to to retrieve their data in the storage, they are always coming from Google storage or AWS S3. But in the future, if you are on BNB, Ethereum or Solana, when you cross the chain, you always can read data from Stratos decentralized storage and it doesn't matter which chain you're using, BNB, Solana or Ethereum. You always can use their native token to pay for the stratos services. I think that question was answered, but yeah, there's a similar concept, a similar solution for them.</p>"},{"location":"stratos-ama-twitter-spaces-03-08-2023/#new-fund-raising","title":"New Fund Raising","text":"<p>Claire</p> <p>Perfect. Thank you. I think, Mixany wants to ask a question? You can feel free to unmute yourself and ask questions.</p> <p>Speaker</p> <p>Hello, Bin. I have a quick question. I just want to know if in the future there is any plan to raise more funds so that we can maybe hire new people and develop the other components?</p> <p>Bin</p> <p>Yeah, we have. Like I mentioned, we have three parts of the tokens. If we raise more funds, we will use the foundation tokens to raise more money with some of the investors. We also want to partner up with some investors. They also can bring resources to us, not only money, funds. We have planned to have the new grant fund raising after mainnet is launched. We will use the tokens in our foundation for that.</p> <p>Speaker</p> <p>Okay, thanks. Thank you very much, BIn.</p> <p>Claire</p> <p>I think we have pretty much covered all the questions from different members from the communities. Does anyone else online with us would like to ask a question live? You still have your last chance to request it and I'll put you on speaker.</p> <p>Speaker</p> <p>Yeah, I would just like to say I love the transparency. Thank you.</p> <p>Bin</p> <p>We will always be. Thank you, Jim.</p> <p>Speaker</p> <p>Thank you very much. I feel very confident with my money with you, Bin. Thank you.</p>"},{"location":"stratos-ama-twitter-spaces-03-08-2023/#short-term-summary","title":"Short-term Summary","text":"<p>Claire</p> <p>Perfect. So no more questions? Maybe, Bin, you want to give a quick summary or a few final words recapping what happened in the past months and also what to look forward in the next two or three months?</p> <p>Bin</p> <p>Yeah. Actually, after answering most of the questions, everything in my mind I want to say is it all said, I think. I very appreciate all the questions. Actually, most of the thing I want to say is already said, and I would like to appreciate it for the whole community You guys are waiting for us for a long, long, long time. I know from 2021 until 2023, it's a long time. Compared with some other projects in DeFI, GameFI, SocialFI, probably takes six months to deliver. But we take much longer than them. We take much longer time even than what I expected. But Stratos project takes two years to prepare for launch of the mainnet. But Stratos project probably will take even much, much longer to be alive and to provide the services. Even the mainnet is launched, we still need more people, more organizations, and more communities, or even traditional businesses to recognize who we are, what we do, what is the benefit we can bring to them. I'm not surprised. They will take maybe months or even year to realize, Oh, this is really something I need. So I hope we already stay here for a long time.</p> <p>Bin</p> <p>I hope we continue to build together, stay together, and to wait for everyone realize how valuable this Stratos project is and what can it bring to this industry, to crypto industry, to crypto project industry, or even to the traditional industries. I don't know what else I can say, but you will feel that. You will feel how powerful it is. I know most of the community, you just saw what we did. What we write, you see what we publish on Twitter, what we said. But if it's possible, I really encourage you guys to try out our SDS. Try to participate in our network. Try to use the SDS to upload, to download, then you can do some comparison with other decentralized storage. Then you will feel differently. Most deeply, it's not what they said to what we see. We want you to try and then you can tell your friends or your other community you know and to say, Okay, this is really different what we deliver. Then you will be dedicated to build on our ecosystem, not just talk about the price. We talk about using the real value to build.</p> <p>Bin</p> <p>When stratos price is going higher, we want to have something that can support that price. Not we give you some big news, the price goes maybe two times and after a month, a week, the price will go back down even lower. Every time when the price goes higher, I really hope that we are going to be driven by our traffic, driven by real value of the money injected in our project. I hope that's the solid way we want to go. We don't want to go rush, but we really want to go solid step by step, like Google, like AWS. Now they are solid enough, but they really took their time. We will take time, but we won't be same like other project. We will be different. Thank you.</p> <p>Claire</p> <p>I think both Bin and myself and the whole team, we're really appreciative. A lot of you guys started this journey with us back in 2021. Remember, the crypto space is ever evolving and there's always something new to develop, to learn. Let's keep exploring, keep questioning and also keep the spirit of innovation alive. So we appreciate your participation and your engagement with us in the communities. I think for a lot of you who may not be that technical, the past two years, maybe you don't feel that hands on enough to engage with the community. But I personally believe once we launch the mainnet, it will be much easier just for the general public to have a real experience with Stratos storage, with Stratos product experience. And that's also the time that we will be able to work more closely in terms of promoting this project. So thank you so much. And just like you heard throughout this AMA, there will be important announcement and events coming up very soon. Please stay connected with our communities throughout our social media channels. We'll be hosting more events like this in the future, so make sure you're on the lookout for upcoming events and discussions. Until next time, let's enjoy this ride and keep working hard. I hope everyone have a great summer.</p>"},{"location":"stratos-ama-twitter-spaces-03-08-2023/#final-word","title":"Final Word","text":"<p>Bin</p> <p>Yeah. Sorry, Claire. I have one thing I want to mention. I forgot about that. Actually, I also continue to encourage our community to hold more STOS. Right now when you run a SDS node, you will get the STOS as a reward. But later on, when we implement more dAPPs, more layers on current storage and for example, when we deliver the CDN, the CDN service will be run on your SDS node as well. When that is ready, you're not only get the STOS tokens from mining pool, you will get extra reward, something from CDN when they're generated the value. You will get that reward. Also that SDS could be used for... Now, it's better maybe not only call SDS because from the three layer, we call resource node. From your resource node, it probably also could build or help the third party to build the decentralized social media. And that all the relay, all the information will be transported between the different resources node available at the moment. You will get the other extra reward. So we will keep adding the value on each of the node. And all the miners who participate. You will get not only stock token as reward, you will get extra tokens.</p> <p>Bin</p> <p>And also hope you could hold STOS token. You can stake in it. But later on, if in our team, we build other layers on top of the Stratos, and if that new layer will have their own token, I can assure you guys when we do that, all the people who hold the STOS token, you will get airdrops because this is partially how the ecosystem of Stratos works. Every new application is built on that. So as a STOS holder, you will get the benefit from that as we are using this as a way to increase our community, increase our ecosystem. That's what I want to say. I forgot about that. Sorry about that.</p> <p>Claire</p> <p>No problem. It's very important addon, and thanks for mentioning that. Thank you very everyone again for your time. Let's continue the discussion in our Telegram Community chat and see you next time. Thank you very much. Have a great day.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"stratos-ama-twitter-spaces-10-02-2023/","title":"AMA on Twitter 10.02.2023","text":"<p> Last update: February 11, 2023</p>"},{"location":"stratos-ama-twitter-spaces-10-02-2023/#welcome-and-updates","title":"Welcome and updates","text":"<p>Claire</p> <p>Alright, good morning, good afternoon and good evening. Let's get it started. My name is Claire and I'm honored to be your host for today. So for those of you who might not joined our previous AMAs, today is an opportunity for you, the community, to ask questions and have them answered in real time. And today we have Bin who will be joining us to answer all your questions and engage in a live and informative discussion. So, without further ado, let's get started. First, I would like to invite Bin to share some of the recent updates about Tropos-5 and what's been happening at Stratos. So I'll pass it to Bin.</p> <p>Bin</p> <p>Thank you, Claire. Thanks to everyone who joined the AMA. And let me give you some updates. Up until today, the Tropos-5, has been running very well for more than three weeks and there are around 4000 active nodes in the network. And also since we implemented a lot of new features and we forbidden other bad nodes to join. So right up to now we saw that about 1500 bad nodes have been banned from the network. So that's why the current Tropos-5 network performance is much better than Tropos-4 and much stable and the uploading and downloading performance do good. And that's the current update for the Tropos-5. We will continue watching it. If we find any issue, we will solve it. And in the meantime, I know a lot of members want to know about the security auditing progress. After today, we already signed NDAs with different security auditing companies. We share the code to them and we also give them relevant documents. They will evaluate the price, they will also evaluate the workload, how much work they need to take. Probably next week some of them will send them their feedback.</p> <p>Maybe after a couple of months, they will give us their monthly results. And in our case, we will use three different points of view to make the final decision on which company we will go with. One, the estimated duration, will it fit with our timeline? Do they have enough people to work on this project? The second one, their history, their working appearance, are they familiar with Cosmos SDK? Are they familiar with P2P, and a lot of other stuff, or are they only familiar with smart contracts? Most of the audit companies are working on smart contracts. But what we are doing is very unique. Not only the public chain, but also the resource node and the meta node, which are very complicated elements, even based on their comments at first glance. Their experience must fit with our needs. The third one for sure is price. We will combine all three of them together. Finally we will choose one to start to kick off the auditing process. Hopefully, that will start next week. But this is also dependent on the feedback from them. After we start the auditing, we will work on the bridge. We have three different options for the bridge:</p> <p>Between the ERC-20 token and the native coin on our own chain. One, we're working with a partner for a bridge. The current bridge project, that's one option. The second option we will implement an \u2018in-house\u2019 bridge. This is dependent on our in-house team. The third one, we will be working on the bridge in the exchange, probably since Gate has most of the liquidity. So probably we will start with Gate. We will negotiate with them if this can be made possible: user sends their ERC-20 tokens to the exchange and when they want to withdraw it, they can choose the network they want to withdraw to. Do they want to withdraw to ETH network or to the Stratos network in the form of our native coin for staking or for activating and running a resource node or a validator node. Just like when you withdraw USDT, you can select a different chain. Right? That's the same thing. So there are three options. We're not sure we will support all three of them or we support two of them. But this one we will work during the security auditing. Then there will be mainnet. I know every day there's someone asking when is mainnet for us.</p> <p>It is really hard to give you the exact date. But you know what we need to get done, right? We need to finish auditing, we need to finish the bridge and we also need to make sure the\u00a0 native token is ready. We will launch the blockchain first so that everyone who wants to participate in the network can get the native coin to run a validator node or to run a resource node. So we will have the blockchain up first in mainnet, then we will start to launch SDS. There won't be a long time between them. Maybe two, three, a couple of weeks. That's the plan. So again, sorry, I cannot give you the details right now. Which date? Morning, afternoon? It's very hard to answer. Okay, that's the update. Maybe we can jump to the questions. Claire?.</p> <p>Claire</p> <p>Thanks Bin, for the high level summarizations for our communities. So now we would like to open up for the community to ask questions. And of course, we will prioritize those who are live with us to go first. So please don't be shy to ask any questions since it's a great opportunity that we can communicate live. And afterwards, if there's no more questions from today's audience, I will hear a few questions that have been left in our comments. So to ask a question, you can simply just request to join as a speaker and I will let you speak here. Robin is raising your hand. Robin, please feel free to ask your questions.</p>"},{"location":"stratos-ama-twitter-spaces-10-02-2023/#question-1-onboarding","title":"Question 1 (onboarding)","text":"<p>Guest 1</p> <p>Hey, guys, Robin here. Thanks for having me. Shout out to Patrick. Yeah, I have a few questions on behalf of someone else who wasn't able to attend the AMA. Some of them were already answered by Bin. So thank you very much for that. And the question that I have here is that are we in touch with Web2 or Web3 companies for an onboarding on Stratos once Mainnet is launched? I know NDA can apply. Just want to know if we are in touch in an advanced way with some.</p> <p>Bin</p> <p>That's a great question and actually we do. Last week and this week we already connected to several companies and projects, I mean companies, traditional companies which require a lot of storage, I even can say, that company is located in Europe. And we also talked to several projects using IPFS and we also talked to other projects so that's ongoing. We want them to try the Tropos-5. We don't want to wait until mainnet. We want them to try the Tropos-5. Tell them to try the SDK, everything. Mainnet is almost there, there won\u2019t be any big chances, if you implement something on Tropos-5, we can now guarantee your data will still be live when we switch to mainnet. So we want them to give it a try and when the mainnet is live, we can launch some projects together with them. And we\u2019re talking to other projects as well. Also maybe something we can announce now, Claire and other team members will go to Denver to participate to ETHDenver because there are a lot of other projects there and we want to go there and showcase our product, to talk about what we want to do, to talk about the vision and we will offer them a chance to try our product, we will bring the computers with us, we will let them try to setup the resource node, to test how fast is it to upload and download a file. Some of our developers will also be there so they can answer technical questions or even code related questions. Basically, we will try to setup more partnerships there and allow more projects to get to know us and let them onboard when mainnet will be launched.</p>"},{"location":"stratos-ama-twitter-spaces-10-02-2023/#question-2-marketing","title":"Question 2 (marketing)","text":"<p>Guest 2</p> <p>Hello, just want to say Stratos is doing an amazing job so far. I have a question regarding marketing. Is the marketing going to sync with the mainnet launch or it\u2019s going to be separated, later, sooner? And can you tell us a bit about it?</p> <p>Bin</p> <p>Yes, actually i think Claire and me can answer this question together. From my point of view, Stratos is not is meme coin and the Stratos project is driven by tech so when we\u2019re doing the marketing, we don\u2019t want to just say what are our innovations, we don\u2019t want to say just what we can accomplish, instead we want to show what we already accomplished so far. That\u2019s the best marketing strategy from my perspective. And also, after a partnership has been accomplished, we will showcase the real use case from that partnership - something already working. So that\u2019s my two cents about marketing and after mainnet is launched, we will probably do something like that. Claire, do you have something to add?</p> <p>Claire</p> <p>Yeah, absolutely, I\u2019m more than happy to address this question and I much understand that many of community members have been eagerly waiting to see campaigns and launches and stuff, but like Bin said, we are a very technical project and from the previous experiences, it shows that having a marketing partner only to shill the project or just promote it, doesn\u2019t yield the best results so we do want to do the marketing right, do it effectively so that\u2019s the reason why when we\u2019re building this comprehensive go-to-market plan, we always plan it along with our product launch, along with partnerships. At the same time, we have been also non-stop building relationships with external marketing resources from all over the world just to make sure we cover it differently. So, i do want to let you guys know that we are keeping this on our roadmap, along with the product milestones. So we hope that you are as excited as us; we will be able to announce a few of the upcoming marketing campaigns but until then, i think that the community helping us spreading the word is also extremely important and it can also be the best way for the rest of the crypto enthusiasts to know more about us, especially now. It\u2019s proven that we have an amazing testnet product that has been reaching the best performance compared to the past testnets. At the same time, if any of you have any marketing resources, or accounts that you want me to look into it, feel free to send them to me, we\u2019re always open to consider to discuss this. I hope this answers your question.</p>"},{"location":"stratos-ama-twitter-spaces-10-02-2023/#question-3-binance-greenfield","title":"Question 3 (Binance Greenfield)","text":"<p>Guest 2</p> <p>Yes, thank you very much. Just one more question if possible quickly as I noticed last week or something, Binance also announced a data storage service. Do you think that that's just going to be a competitor or are they going to do something much different?</p> <p>Bin</p> <p>Yeah, I think Greenfield is their project name. They will be a competitor but its good. We already have several competitors like Filecoin, Arweave. Even when we started the Stratos project, there were two projects already set up for a couple of years already and they are still here. We don\u2019t fear any of the new competitors. And from a technical perspective, there is no magic happening in this field, so we know how it works. Just different people that focus on different ways, like us. Stratos is more focused on the traffic reward and traffic volume. Filecoin and Arweave are more focused on how to store the cold data. It\u2019s the data you don\u2019t need. You start there and you don\u2019t even need to access it. If you access it, maybe it will be very slow but no one cares. So we will focus on a different market. Even in the decentralized storage, we still have the different narrative for us, for Web3 and our social files. Is the data you will probably access very often, like Twitter for example. If we want to build a decentralized Twitter, there will be so many people that will refresh the page they are reading, all the tweets, all the videos, all the images. It\u2019s not cold data, it\u2019s traffic, it\u2019s hot data, even for TikTok. So we are more focused on the hot data. Frankly, I\u2019m not sure about Greenfield, what are the details? How will they build their system? I didn\u2019t see any mention in their white paper. But we won\u2019t know. Will they focus on stalling the information and save it there forever? Ore they want to do something like content delivery and accelerate the process of content delivery? I\u2019m not sure but we are very different from other projects and we are very confident to surpass any competitors. It\u2019s good actually, it's a good sign: people, a lot of VCs will see more projects joining the storage narrative and think this has a lot of potential, it will attract more funds, more people, more resources.</p>"},{"location":"stratos-ama-twitter-spaces-10-02-2023/#question-4-website-roadmap","title":"Question 4 (Website roadmap)","text":"<p>Guest 3</p> <p>Okay, so I have a few quick questions. The really small first question is do you plan to rework the website pretty soon? Because I feel like having the whole road map was really good. Now we can't really see the computational database on the roadmap, so I'm guessing after mainnet, you're going to bring it back, is that correct?</p> <p>Bin</p> <p>Okay, that's one question. Okay, let's do this question first. Yes, probably we will redo our website but just not now, maybe after the mainnet, when the time allows, we will rebuild our official website for sure. As for the decentralized computation and the decentralized database, we didn\u2019t add them to the road map right now because we really want to dedicate ourselves to deliver the blockchain and the decentralized storage first. And probably you are wondering if after storage, we will jump right on to computation, the transfer is no. We will work on computation but not right away. The reason is, we want to work on something to help another project or another partner, if they have any requirements or if they have their own requests. We will continue to improve our decentralized storage for them so it\u2019s a more friendly environment or even improve the performance. Or, if someone wants to use it as a CDN, have some particular features, we will work on that first. We will also implement some DApps on our storage first. If we implement some DApps, one or two of them on our storage, we want them to be open source. We want to show everyone how easy it is to use Stratos and how good it is when you deploy your DApp on Stratos. So we want to get more developers to switch to us and work with us. That\u2019s one reason. The second reason is we want to work on storage to get more traction. Also because we want to get more data stored with some company or with a video or audio project. If they switch to us, they will probably have other needs like encoding for example. They will need to encode, to decode, to do real time streaming so they will raise a demand. Okay, what should we do? Where can we find the computing power for the encoding, decoding and streaming? When we will work on computation, we don\u2019t just want to do it as we think it will fit our users needs. No, we really want to work with them to implement features and computation to directly satisfy their requirements. So there are some requirements we want to get from people that are using our storage directly so that will be a more efficient way to working on computation, that\u2019s why we want to gather requirements first. The same thing applies to database. After we have storage and computation, they will have a requirement to store some final result on the database, right? So when they have a requirement, we will make a plan and we will implement one by one, then we will update the milestone.</p>"},{"location":"stratos-ama-twitter-spaces-10-02-2023/#question-5-mainnet-schedule","title":"Question 5 (Mainnet schedule)","text":"<p>Guest 3</p> <p>Okay, good, thanks. That's super clear. That's super clear. So I was wondering does that mean that blockchain and storage are coming at the same time?</p> <p>Bin</p> <p>Pretty much yeah, almost the same time. But the blockchain will come first. Maybe after a couple of weeks the storage will come.</p> <p>Like i just mentioned, we want people to have time to swap their ERC-20 tokens to the native coin so they are prepared to setup their own validators and SDS nodes.</p>"},{"location":"stratos-ama-twitter-spaces-10-02-2023/#question-6-ipfs","title":"Question 6 (IPFS)","text":"<p>Guest 3</p> <p>Okay, so, final question, so you talked about IPFS on Twitter yesterday and I was wondering does that mean we can use it? Because I have an energy project, I want to host it on Stratos. Is that possible? Can we host images files and use them in smart contracts just like IPFS?</p> <p>Bin</p> <p>Yeah, actually we implemented something to make SDS compatible with IPFS. You may have to use the API, maybe some SDK or you can even use our code. You don\u2019t need to change your code if it\u2019s already implemented on IPFS. But some projects will still need to implement them into the code in order to store anything, images, video or audio, on Stratos storage. Be we also think about different ways to make it easier.</p> <p>Guest 3</p> <p>Okay, thank you. That's right, I'm probably going to use it. That's why I was asking. I wasn't really sure about this. So thank you for the answer.</p> <p>Bin</p> <p>I encourage you to try. You can try to upload a file right now and you just have to have an SDS node and I know you have a digital asset. You upload it and you download it right now. It's command prompt. Also we have some SDK you can try out. It will be very similar when mainnet launches.</p> <p>Claire</p> <p>Does anyone else have questions to ask? Please raise your hand. Otherwise I'll pass it back to Robin because I know he still has a few questions in mind. Robin, I think you can ask the rest of your questions.</p>"},{"location":"stratos-ama-twitter-spaces-10-02-2023/#question-7-ai","title":"Question 7 (AI)","text":"<p>Guest 1</p> <p>Awesome. Yeah. This is a question I quote from another community member regarding the recent interest and hype around AI technology. I understand that with the decentralized computation part of Stratos we can train deep learning algorithms, et cetera. Can't we also advertise this feature on our website and be in the AI category on CoinGecko and Coin Market Cap to raise more awareness and new public for Stratos network?</p> <p>Bin</p> <p>Yeah, that could be done but since we\u2019re not implementing that feature yet, the computation component isn\u2019t even started to be build yet. But we can add a tag on coingecko and coinmarketcap and when we rebuild our official website, we can add that to get some feedback. Yesterday we had a conversation internally to add some use cases on our website so that more people could learn about our capabilities more easily.</p>"},{"location":"stratos-ama-twitter-spaces-10-02-2023/#question-8-exchanges","title":"Question 8 (Exchanges)","text":"<p>Guest 1</p> <p>Awesome. Yeah. Two quick questions, one personal question. Have you ever considered listing on other exchanges? For example, on Kucoin just to spark up some volume and get some more recognition?</p> <p>Bin</p> <p>Yes, we do. But before we launch the tokens on a new exchange, I prefer to launch the mainnet first. The reason is, if we launch before, the ERC-20 will need to be migrated to the native coin and that is very much work. So everything will happen together, we make some announcements, then we launch some partnerships with traditional business or a crypto project, then we will have some traction. Also, when the traffic picks up on mainnet, probably some exchanges will come to talk to us, or we go talk to them. But once we have more traction, it will be easier to make the deal with new exchanges.</p>"},{"location":"stratos-ama-twitter-spaces-10-02-2023/#question-9-marketing","title":"Question 9 (Marketing)","text":"<p>Guest 1</p> <p>Last question. As a community, what can we do and what should we absolutely not do to promote Stratos on social media? I know certain influencers who we already have on board, but for other community members who are excited to share the news, what would you like to see us do as a community and what are the absolute don'ts?</p> <p>Claire</p> <p>So first of all, I think we all should give a big round of applause to the Stratos community. As I always said, I think Stratos community has a much better and deeper understanding in terms of navigating the whole tech space in this crypto space. So we definitely welcome everyone to share more content on social media, whether it's Twitter or any other platform that you're more familiar with. On the other hand, I think we're never afraid of comparing ourselves with other competitors. And like you said, we are always confident with the performances. So I suggest that we always keep our narrative around decentralized storage and decentralized cloud. So no matter whichever new narrative comes in, bear in mind that the whole storage industry, the whole storage space can be utilized for any kind of projects. Whether you are in crypto or not, whether you're a Web2 or Web3, whether you are AI or you are just simply traditional financial companies. It covers all, literally. Plus that the whole decentralized storage gives you full ownership of the files and also the security. So I think these should be the messages we all should focus on when you're helping us, spreading out the word.And on top of that, I do think the community power is indefinite. So a lot of you guys may have in contacts or connections with different kind of projects or companies, whichever you think there will be an opportunity for us to talk, feel free to put us together. We will also consider how to give back to our communities who contribute a lot to the growth of the whole ecosystem. But those are some of the things I can think of right now. And on behalf of the team, we do appreciate everyone has been fully believing us and helping us, promoting the technology that we are actually building nonstop. So I hope this covers it all. And again, my DM, my Telegram is always open. If you want to exchange ideas about marketing, feel free.</p> <p>Guest 1</p> <p>Yeah, totally. I think your marketing is spot on. Absolutely. And if something comes up to my mind, I'll definitely know where to find you. Thank you very much. Both and have a wonderful day. Thank you so much.</p>"},{"location":"stratos-ama-twitter-spaces-10-02-2023/#question-10-use-cases","title":"Question 10 (Use cases)","text":"<p>Guest 4</p> <p>I just have a question for Bin, I'm just wondering when the real world industry would be ready for decentralized storage and what can Stratos mean in that concept? And in what time frame do you think this can happen?</p> <p>Bin</p> <p>Okay, this is a great question. So actually I can give you some feedback. Actually, I mentioned last week when we talked to some traditional business. Their concerns where the following: Okay,we really like Stratos. We want to try to deposit the data to your platform. One is, what's the price? Because for them, they don't care about Stratos. They don't care if storage price is one dollar or $10 or whatever, but they care about paying by fiat currency. Okay, that's one. The second one, what's the capability of the network? If I want to put huge amounts of data on your network, is your network strong enough, it's big enough? That's the second concern. Okay. The third one, is this network an open network. It's not like Google, AWS all the other clouds. If they have an issue they cannot deal with because of any political issue or any other issues, they probably could shut you down right away, but we won't. So that's the real challenge question from the traditional business. So how can we make adoption for them?</p> <p>And we are thinking maybe we will be working with a third party or we will be working by ourselves to build a middle layer between Stratos and traditional businesses. That middle layer will then charge the fiat currency directly and then convert it to STOS and pay fo the storage on the Stratos network. So ourselves or alongside a 3rd party, we will work to make this middle layer more friendly, to get more traditional businesses on board.</p> <p>For the second question, actually, in our field, everyone knows about crypto. But we are still a small group compared to the real world. In real world, maybe 10 people out of 100 know about crypto or hold crypto. But in the following couple of years, more and more people will know about crypto. And i feel maybe in a couple of years, countries will have different regulations. I\u2019m waiting for that time when the new regulations will allow big companies to directly purchase eth or stos to store and to pay he consumed storage. So, if I were to give you and estimated time frame, I think that could be happening in roughly three years.</p>"},{"location":"stratos-ama-twitter-spaces-10-02-2023/#question-11-stratos-database","title":"Question 11 (Stratos Database)","text":"<p>Guest 5</p> <p>I\u2019m looking at the old road map you had on the website and on that road map, we can see that computation and database will take a full year after all the storage and blockchain, is that still accurate? Let\u2019s say storage and blockchain come in six months. Does that mean that a year later we probably have computation and database?</p> <p>Bin</p> <p>Actually I think I covered that question earlier. It\u2019s hard to give and estimated date for mainnet. We don\u2019t just want to deliver the project, we also want people to use it as a real se case before we go on with the next step. Because most team members of Stratos come from traditional businesses. We developed products for traditional businesses and now we have switched to the crypto industry.But we just feel the bar is different to be honest. If a project in traditional business just works, it\u2019s a bad product but in crypto, even if a product just works, it\u2019s an awesome thing, it doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s easier to use or not so that\u2019s why up to now, everyone is talking about Web3. Everyone talks about DApps except the DApps are used for swap, for transfers on blockchain, to pay for gas. But for DeFi, we really didn\u2019t see much. Real GameFi or real SocialFi projects, there are no real products there at all. They are actually centralized projects just to have a token, that\u2019s all. But for us, we really want to build a real user case. For someone to really use it everyday or every month. That\u2019s what we want to dedicate to for now. That\u2019s why we will take some time to onboard some projects, maybe during the onboarding they will have certain requirements, we will work to satisfy them. So before we have real use case, before people really store their data on storage, we won\u2019t start the computation phase. Sure, we have the documentation, we have the designs and plans for how we will be building computation and database but before storage is totally working, we won\u2019t kick off that plan.</p>"},{"location":"stratos-ama-twitter-spaces-10-02-2023/#question-12-webcam-storage","title":"Question 12 (Webcam storage)","text":"<p>Guest 6</p> <p>What I think that is very suitable for Stratos is if the webcams recordings can be stored on Stratos because the fees in all the apps that are on the place, on the App Store are very high.</p> <p>Bin</p> <p>I agree with you. I think this is a very good use case for storage and computing. Now, that camera is everywhere. You put that camera in the house, in the warehouse, in front of your door, in your car, in the office, everywhere. And there is a lot of storage in Gigabytes. That camera is very storage consuming. They probably want to store all the recorded video and keep it for one month, three months or even longer. Since Stratos can provide a solid and cheaper storage solution. It's durable for sure. And by that one I feel we will do this in two steps. The first step is for anyone that is using a camera and since most of the web cameras right now, the storage is kind of expensive and if you don't want to lose your history web camera data, videos, probably you can manually or you can write some code to transport your videos from the expensive storage solution to Stratos. That's one. That's the first step. The second step is when the computation is ready and probably we can work with some camera companies, they can direct it to streaming the data to storage. Looks like they are just streaming the data to storage, but streaming and encoding, they need computation power. That's why that will be the second step when the computations are available. So after that maybe some people could make the choice. They want to continue the centralized storage of cloud to do the streaming or they could choose the stratas as a decentralized solution to store under the streaming of their data.</p> <p>Claire</p> <p>Awesome. So I think we do not have any further questions. If you do, please take the last chance. Otherwise we'll be ready to conclude today's AMA session. So once again a big thank you to everyone for joining us today and especially to thank you for following along Stratos journey. We hope you find this AMA informative and engaging. Don't forget to follow us on Twitter, Telegram or discord. Feel free to chat in our communities if you have any questions and hope you have a great afternoon.

But I want to be honest with you guys. We have a very good relationship with most investors, we have routine conversations with them weekly or monthly, I can give you some names like Fenbushi. We also talk to Fundamental Labs very often, with DFG, as well as with several others but unfortunately, not all investors in Stratos are very active. Some never had a conversation with us after they invested. Probably they have their own issues, they were a long time holder, they hold it from one dollar, two, tree, five, then back to two dollars, one dollar, they never dumped. But I guess this is a free market. Maybe they had personal issues or maybe they had company temporary issues so they wanted to sell. It\u2019s normal. It doesn't mean that they lost confidence or lost faith in us. Just like in the real world, everyone can make their own decisions. So i just wanted you to know that we have a very good relationship with most of the investors and they keep supporting us and some investors keep introducing even more projects and partners to us. I know maybe you are a bit worried but I say don\u2019t worry, everything is good. But we need to accept that someone in a particular situation, they need to make their own decisions.</p> <p>Guest 6</p> <p>Okay, yeah, it's a free market. That's exactly what it is, man.

I'm sure our community really appreciates yours and our team's honesty and transparency. So thanks for addressing this special topic and I fully agree with you that I do think we have been maintaining a very good relationship with our investors and other partners projects.

Since we're all part of this community, I feel right at home. Let's kick off our AMA. First, let's provide you all with some updates from the technical side. </p>"},{"location":"stratos-ama-twitter-spaces-12-02-2024/#version-twelve","title":"Version \"Twelve\"","text":"<p>Currently, the team is putting in a tremendous effort on our major release, which we've internally dubbed \"version twelve.\" This version is nearly complete, and we're in the midst of testing it rigorously. Our plan is to conduct tests on version twelve within our Mesos, akin to the last test version prior to Mainnet. We aim to deploy the new version on Mesos in early March and let it run for a while. Assuming everything goes smoothly, we'll then commence deployment of version twelve at Mainnet. </p>"},{"location":"stratos-ama-twitter-spaces-12-02-2024/#share2earn","title":"Share2Earn","text":"<p>There's a plethora of exciting features packed into version twelve, and I'll share a few examples. Firstly, there's \"share to earn.\" I've talked about this concept for quite some time now. Essentially, it means that currently, only miners can earn the $STOS token when they contribute their servers. However, with \"share to earn,\" if anyone uploads content such as games, videos, or audio, and if that content attracts a significant number of downloads or plays, thereby generating traffic, they'll be eligible to earn rewards.</p> <p>The content owner will receive these tokens every ten minutes, as well. This means their traffic will undergo proof of traffic consensus every ten minutes, and they will receive rewards accordingly. So, later on, it won't just be miners who benefit; good content producers can also mine these tokens by the minute. That's significant. </p> <p>Our aim is to use this feature to attract more people to participate in the Stratos network. We're not just providing storage; we're not just offering efficient decentralized storage. We also aim to become a high-quality content center or network where people can deliver their excellent content to the world via Stratos. That's one aspect. </p>"},{"location":"stratos-ama-twitter-spaces-12-02-2024/#volume-reporting","title":"Volume Reporting","text":"<p>The second aspect is that we'll continue to improve our volume reporting, meaning the proof of traffic consensus. The new volume report will be included in version twelve as well. This enhancement is more for miners, so the volume report performance will be even better than before. </p>"},{"location":"stratos-ama-twitter-spaces-12-02-2024/#smart-contract-for-prepay","title":"Smart contract for prepay","text":"<p>The third aspect is also substantial. We're starting to support smart contracts for prepayment. Okay, what does that mean? It means that when smart contracts support prepayment, Stratos will begin to support storage and cross-chain functionalities. </p> <p>For instance, when we collaborate with Polygon or later with other chains, users won't even need to possess $STOS. They can directly use Matic or their native tokens to pay for $STOS, ozone, and the DEX. Cooperation between different chains and Stratos will seamlessly allow for this. So, even if someone doesn't know, \"What's $STOS?\" they can still make payments. </p>"},{"location":"stratos-ama-twitter-spaces-12-02-2024/#native-dex","title":"Native DEX","text":"<p>Additionally, we can launch the DEX on the Stratos chain. Therefore, if users have Ethereum or Solana, or if we support any other chain, they can directly interact with Stratos. This feature is crucial because we want to eliminate any barriers for communities to use Stratos storage. They simply need to consume their own tokens to utilize Stratos. This is the third feature we will deliver. </p>"},{"location":"stratos-ama-twitter-spaces-12-02-2024/#ibc-integration","title":"IBC Integration","text":"<p>The fourth one addresses a common question: when will IBC be ready? It will be ready with this version as well. So, when we launch IBC, we will officially connect to all participants in the Cosmos ecosystem.</p> <p>So, when the IBC protocol is ready on the Stratos chain, people will not only be able to use the Uniswap DEX, but they can also utilize any Cosmos DEX to trade Stratos tokens. These are the four major features for the new version, which we'll likely deploy on the Mesos Testnet in early March. Then, once everything checks out, we'll begin launching it on Mainnet. </p> <p>Additionally, we have numerous other small changes and features aimed at improving the performance of the Stratos decentralized network.</p>"},{"location":"stratos-ama-twitter-spaces-12-02-2024/#partnerships","title":"Partnerships","text":"<p>Now, moving on to partnerships. Recently, we've been actively engaging with various partners, including public chains and entities in the metaverse, AI, or GameFi space. We're striving to connect with as many project teams as possible. </p> <p>Most of these projects require storage, and lately, we've also started discussing data availability. When their validators need to roll up or process data, they need to locate the data they're processing. Stratos can effectively provide data availability for them.</p> <p>Due to our multiple replications on the chain, each copy of the data is situated in a different geographical area. Currently, we have at least five copies spanning across North America, Asia, and Europe. As our network expands with more nodes, we can further increase the replication numbers. This setup ensures that regardless of the validators' locations, they can always find the nearest copy, which is crucial.</p> <p>Even more importantly, when we provide these replications globally, we enable validators to verify that each copy is identical. They can trace these copies to ensure they are original and unaltered. This ability prevents tampering or the addition of fraudulent transactions, as validators can easily verify the hash code on the Stratos chain. </p> <p>We're emphasizing this narrative because it's not only crucial for the Ethereum ecosystem, including L1, L2, and potential L3 solutions, but also for improving efficiency and reducing gas prices. These are areas where we believe we can provide valuable assistance.</p> <p>We've also continued our collaboration with our third-party partner, Lighthouse. Previously, I hadn't disclosed their name, but they're known as Lighthouse, and they're a great team. We've completed the frontend development, and now the Lighthouse team is working on integration. They've provided valuable suggestions regarding SDS, recommending the addition of RPC APIs. So far, everything is progressing smoothly, and we're continuing to focus on integration. Once this phase is complete, we'll likely release the test version of the decentralized Dropbox soon.</p> <p>Additionally, we're persistently engaged with AI projects, striving to demonstrate our unique value proposition to them. We aim to illustrate why they should consider Stratos and how it can enhance the decentralization, efficiency, and security of their projects. This is our ongoing effort on the partnership and ecosystem side.</p>"},{"location":"stratos-ama-twitter-spaces-12-02-2024/#listings","title":"Listings","text":"<p>Moreover, we're dedicated to enhancing our listings. Currently, our priority is to boost liquidity and deepen our pool, making it easier for people to purchase or trade Stratos tokens. This focus reflects our commitment to improving accessibility and usability for our community.</p> <p>Yeah, this year, it's challenging to predict when we'll be able to get $STOS listed on some of the top exchanges\u2014not necessarily the number one exchange, but certainly within the top ten. We're making efforts in that direction, but it's difficult for me to provide a precise estimation of when and which exchanges we'll be targeting. However, we're determined to make progress in this regard, and I'm hopeful that it could happen in 2024.</p> <p>So, that's the major update for now. I'd like to open the floor to the community.

Is that something you're looking into?</p> <p>Bin</p> <p>Yeah, I actually saw someone mention that in our community channels yesterday. To be honest, I'm not sure if future trading is beneficial for communities or not. I'm not an expert in trading strategies, but we're in communication with GateIO. If they're interested in listing us on their futures trading platform, I'm open to that. However, if they require payment for it and an application process, I'd prefer to wait. It seems riskier to me. When you're trading futures, there's potential for manipulation. </p> <p>Again, I'm not an expert in this area, but I'm more concerned about ensuring that people who hold or stake $STOS can easily purchase or trade it. As for trading in the futures market, I'm unsure about its benefits. However, if the opportunity arises to list on a larger exchange in the future, one bigger than GateIO, I'd be open to considering it. For instance, if they offer a package where you can trade spot or futures, that's something I'd consider. I'll definitely keep this in mind, and if there's a chance to engage with a new, larger exchange, I'll explore the possibility of including it in our offerings.</p>"},{"location":"stratos-ama-twitter-spaces-12-02-2024/#exposure","title":"Exposure","text":"<p>Speaker</p> <p>Thank you, Bin. There's something else as well as a person that's not very technical, I know a bit about crypto, but I mean I'm not technical and stuff like that. What I'm saying is when do you think we're going to start on-boarding people, a lot of people. Do you understand? When are people going to start thinking, oh yeah, I need to use Stratos because I've noticed we're not in all the sectors of DePIN and I think we're missing out. I've noticed in many charts we're not there. I think we need to be more vocal about being in the DePIN sector.</p> <p>Bin</p> <p>If I understand correctly, you're referring to the current situation where mainly miners participate in the Stratos network by providing storage nodes, staking, and facilitating file uploads and downloads to generate traffic. However, when you mention that people can participate, you mean that individuals without their own nodes can still upload and download files. Is that what you're asking?</p> <p>Speaker</p> <p>Yeah, I just mean like where people are going to be using it, where we're going to get more eyes on the project.</p> <p>Bin</p> <p>Yeah, I see what you mean. Essentially, with the decentralized Dropbox, once the dApp is ready, I want to encourage more people to give it a try. </p> <p>If someone has a funny video or some interesting content they want to share with others, they can simply use the app directly through their web browsers. You can upload, download, or share content with anyone, making it accessible to all users. </p> <p>One particularly exciting aspect is the share to earn feature. Once it's ready, we'd like to conduct some case studies. For example, if you upload compelling content that attracts a lot of attention, it could generate significant traffic, leading to potential earnings. We want to demonstrate that creating content and sharing it on Stratos' decentralized storage can be financially rewarding. </p> <p>While sharing content on platforms like YouTube or Twitter might earn you revenue based on impressions, uploading it to Stratos and generating organic traffic could also earn you $STOS tokens. It's all about providing incentives for users to engage with and contribute to the platform.</p> <p>Also, the entire reward processing is completely transparent. You can easily track each volume report, which clearly outlines the traffic and how it translates into rewards. With each volume report, you can see exactly what you should earn. </p> <p>This transparency stands in stark contrast to centralized platforms like YouTube, where the reward structure is often a mystery, hidden behind a black box. </p> <p>We believe in full disclosure and transparency, showing you the entire process so that everyone can verify it for themselves if they're interested. This approach is designed to appeal to non-technical individuals and non-miners, allowing them to actively engage with the platform. </p> <p>And to participate, they'll need STOS tokens for now. We hope that by offering such transparency and accessibility, we'll attract more people to join our community and help it grow. This is just the beginning, and moving forward, we'll be exploring ways to expand our reach in the market, ensuring that more and more people are aware of the dApps we're building and the opportunities they present.</p> <p>Everyone is welcome to use our platform. For those who aren't satisfied with Google Drive or Dropbox and prefer to have control over their content without censorship or the risk of their accounts or content being deleted by centralized companies, Stratos offers a viable alternative. </p> <p>By holding STOS tokens, users become the rightful owners of their content indefinitely. They have full management permissions over their own files, ensuring that their data remains secure and under their control. Remember, if it's not your key, it's not your content. Thank you for your support, and we're committed to making this a reality very soon.</p>"},{"location":"stratos-ama-twitter-spaces-12-02-2024/#educational-videos","title":"Educational Videos","text":"<p>Speaker</p> <p>There's another thing as well. Have you got like a video editing team? Can you not go onto YouTube and maybe start giving video tutorials about what's coming or what's happening? For people like me, that will understand a lot easier. And for the new crypto people, when they say Stratos, they want to see what's happening with this project, see a visual and see explaining. Oh yeah, Stratos does this, Stratos does that. A bit of explanation.</p> <p>Bin</p> <p>Yeah, you're absolutely right. \"Understanding Crypto\" has been a valuable and active member of our community. His recent educational videos on YouTube have been fantastic, providing valuable insights for everyone. Looking ahead, once the decentralized Dropbox is ready, we can explore creating new videos to educate people on how to use it step by step. </p> <p>Platforms like YouTube can be excellent tools for showcasing the functionality of the decentralized Dropbox and explaining why it's beneficial to use. By demonstrating its features and highlighting the benefits, we can encourage more people to embrace decentralized solutions and experience the advantages firsthand.

Here's something else as well. Can we say consistent every month for AMa? Because when new holders come in the bull market, this is what they like. They like to see what's happening. They like to listen to the questions and talk because we're not in the full bull market yet. But when we are, there's going to be people wanting to listen to what's happening.</p> <p>Bin</p> <p>Absolutely, I'm on board with that. Monthly updates sound like a great plan. And if there are any significant developments or if the community has a lot of questions, we can certainly increase the frequency of our communications. I'm completely comfortable with that. </p> <p>As you know, transparency is key for me when it comes to engaging with our community. I'm committed to providing clear and honest updates, without adding any fluff.

Listen, there's another thing I want to ask you because it's just playing on my mind because I know you're very transparent. There's only one more question I need to ask. When we're at zero point 72, and we were ranging between a certain part and we couldn't get high above zero point 85 or zero point 82 or whatever it was the person kept selling off, I bought about 30 k's worth of token. I'm wondering, how can someone sell off that many tokens? I'm just wondering, is it the team or not? Because I know you're transparent. It's just one question on my mind that I wanted to ask.</p> <p>Bin</p> <p>Yeah, sorry, it's not us. So I have no idea. Perhaps it's an early investor or someone who bought in at a low point, maybe around the 50-cent mark, and decided to sell to capitalize on their investment. Or it could be anyone, really\u2014I'm not entirely sure. It's not something the team has been involved in or orchestrated. So it's difficult for me to provide a definitive answer. </p> <p>Sometimes, even a year or two ago, during the summer, some individuals were selling for less than $0.20. But ultimately, trading doesn't require permission from anyone, and people are free to make their own decisions. They might sell because they need the money or for other personal reasons. We understand that. </p> <p>We've been working hard, but we don't aim to control or manage the price. That's not something we've ever done or intend to do.</p>"},{"location":"stratos-ama-twitter-spaces-12-02-2024/#stratos-in-6-months","title":"Stratos in 6 months","text":"<p>Speaker</p> <p>I'm very happy with the project.

Do you think we'll have 10% more holders? Where can you see us in six months time, please?</p> <p>Bin</p> <p>Yes, exactly. Over the next six months, we anticipate having more leverage from the product side. We're rolling out features that users can directly utilize, such as the share to earn functionality, which is designed to attract content producers to our network. Additionally, our participation in the Cosmos ecosystem allows people to trade $STOS tokens on Cosmos SD decks. We're also partnering with numerous AI projects, which are starting to use Stratos storage and generate more traffic. Looking ahead, after this version, we plan to focus on the computing component of Stratos. These are all exciting developments that will strengthen our community and enhance Stratos' performance over the next six months.</p> <p>As for the broader market outlook, while some speculate about the timing of the bull market\u2014whether it's in 2024 or 2025\u2014we're focused on making ourselves stronger and more resilient regardless of when it arrives.

However, I think personally, Stratos is lacking a little bit of front end. Like the backend obviously, is really amazing. You've already showed some examples. However, the front end, I think investors will need to see more of what Stratos actually does. You already mentioned about the Dropbox system that's coming and the wallet app you have. But can you also make something on a browser like AWS has or MongoDB, like those type of products?</p> <p>We only have a wallet which need to be downloaded and downloading stuff from the Internet, especially in crypto, is not recommended. So maybe in browser it just welcomes more people. Also staking on the site. Make it easier to stake your $STOS by connecting to the website or anything like that.</p> <p>Bin</p> <p>That's a great question. Currently, we're focused on developing the CDN layers, and as we delve into this, we're considering various scenarios. For instance, when you watch YouTube, you're not the one paying for the traffic\u2014the business behind the content does. However, with Stratos Wallet, users would be responsible for paying for the traffic, albeit in small amounts. This payment would occur when users watch videos, listen to music, or download content they enjoy.</p> <p>Regarding your inquiry about potential business logic behind this model, it's definitely something we're exploring. We're considering whether it's feasible to create a light version of Stratos Wallet or even develop it as a browser plugin. While this may not be a high priority at the moment, it could become crucial in the future, especially if we want to attract more non-technical users to participate. Your suggestion is valuable, and it's something we'll keep in mind as we continue to evolve and expand our platform.</p> <p>Absolutely, security is paramount, and we always prioritize keeping everyone's assets safe. We wouldn't want anyone's assets to be at risk due to using an unsafe plugin. It's crucial to strike a balance between security and ease of use. Your suggestion is indeed a fantastic approach to making participation easier for users. They wouldn't even need to fill their wallet initially\u2014they could simply set a password or use a secure method to access their wallet when they refresh their browsers.</p> <p>I'll need to discuss this further with the team and explore the feasibility of implementing such a solution. Your ideas are valuable, especially as we're looking into potential partnerships for streaming content. Finding a way to allow partners to stream content without requiring them to install the wallet presents its own set of challenges, and your suggestion could very well be the solution we're looking for. Thank you for your input\u2014I'll definitely consider it as we continue to develop and refine our platform.</p> <p>That's precisely why the team is currently focused on developing the CDN layer. When it comes to streaming videos and audios, it's inefficient for us to download the content each time someone wants to watch it. Instead, we're implementing a system where we aggregate requests and store the content in the CDN layer. This way, if multiple people want to watch the same video, it's already available for them to access without the need for multiple downloads.</p> <p>As for who will cover the costs associated with hosting this content, that's where the business layer comes into play. The entity or individual who created the content will be responsible for covering the expenses. However, as more people view the content, there's also the potential for earnings. This could come from sources such as advertisements or information dissemination, where the content creator stands to benefit from increased viewership.</p> <p>In essence, the CDN layer serves as an efficient and cost-effective solution for streaming content, while the business logic behind it ensures that the costs are covered and potentially leads to additional revenue streams for content creators. We're dedicated to refining this system to make it as seamless and beneficial as possible for all parties involved.</p> <p>Indeed, the CDN layer is geared towards collaborating with larger business enterprises that require decentralized storage or a decentralized Video Delivery Network (VDN) to support their operations. We're actively preparing to meet the needs of these enterprises and provide them with the decentralized infrastructure they require to enhance their businesses. Our goal is to offer a robust and reliable solution that meets the demands of enterprise-level clients while leveraging the benefits of decentralized technology. We're committed to delivering a seamless and effective platform that empowers businesses to thrive in the digital landscape.</p> <p>Speaker</p> <p>Yeah, sounds amazing. Sounds amazing. I think decentralized storage really is the future and especially what you guys are building. So good job. Good job. Thank you for your time.</p>"},{"location":"stratos-ama-twitter-spaces-12-02-2024/#ai","title":"AI","text":"<p>Bin</p> <p>Thank you, everyone. Before we delve into any other questions, I'd like to share some ideas and concepts with our community, particularly concerning AI. AI, especially OpenAI's Chat GPT, has been gaining considerable traction lately. Many influential individuals are excited about its potential. However, there's another side to this story.</p> <p>Consider the rise of Chat GPT and its integration into various sectors such as journalism, marketing, and more. Previously, most online content, whether videos, articles, or news, was authored by people, albeit with a fair share of copy-pasting. But now, with the widespread adoption of Chat GPT, the creation process has shifted. Many individuals simply provide an idea or a sentence or two and rely on Chat GPT to generate the entire piece. Consequently, more and more content is being produced by AI, not humans. I liken this phenomenon to pollution.</p> <p>Why pollution? Because Chat GPT's power stems from learning from human-created content. It doesn't generate original ideas; it regurgitates what it's been fed. Over time, it's become incredibly efficient at this, learning in months what humans took years to accumulate. However, when AI starts generating content independently, it creates a cycle where AI feeds off AI. This leads to a future where AI doesn't rely on human-generated content anymore. Instead, it feeds off its own creations, controlling the information people consume.</p> <p>This poses a significant challenge. If AI dominates content creation, there's a risk of losing control over our culture and our data. Social media platforms like Twitter and YouTube, as well as traditional news outlets, are vulnerable. However, decentralized storage solutions could provide a safeguard. By storing our content on decentralized platforms, we retain ownership and control. It's crucial, especially as AI's influence grows.</p> <p>Perhaps our private keys could serve as a barrier. If we collaborate with AI, there should be a mechanism where AI compensates us for our content. Sharing to earn could be one such model. Stratos finds itself at a crucial juncture. While AI's dominance raises concerns, it also presents opportunities. Protecting our data, whether it's videos, audio files, or intellectual property, will become increasingly vital.</p> <p>If you've been following our tweets, you might have noticed a recurring theme\u2014data management and protection are paramount. This is a narrative we believe will become increasingly relevant in the coming years.</p>"},{"location":"stratos-ama-twitter-spaces-12-02-2024/#native-stos-on-cexes","title":"Native STOS on CEX'es","text":"<p>Speaker</p> <p>Is there any chance that you can get the native stratos chain support on MEXC and what's the other one? AscendEX.</p> <p>Bin</p> <p>Actually, a couple of years ago, we collaborated with Ascendex to list STOS on Ascendax. At that time, Ascendex was still, to be honest, I don't want to speak ill of them. But following a significant event, about half a year later, Ascendex fell victim to a hack, resulting in the loss of approximately $70 million. </p> <p>Subsequently, liquidity and daily trading volume on Ascendex deteriorated significantly. </p> <p>To be frank, based on the data they've provided, Ascendex no longer seems like a reputable exchange. It's become very difficult for me to trust them. Even though we partnered with them officially in the beginning, I still wouldn't advise our community to trade there. If it were to happen, I wouldn't want members of the Stratos community or anyone else trading there to risk losing their assets. That's my concern, that's one reason. The second issue concerns Mex, but that's a different story altogether. Mex offered us a free listing; they initiated the listing themselves, and we didn't have to pay anything or provide liquidity.</p> <p>We don't have a market maker for fitting their basic regulatory trading volumes. We didn't cooperate with anything related to that. Even when our main net was ready in September last year, we reached out to them. Yes, we communicated with them. However, most of the people we collaborated with long before have all left. We couldn't find new contacts managing that trading pair. Therefore, we never received a response from them. We asked if they could support the native token, but they never responded. Perhaps all the people we spoke to had already left the exchange, or maybe they weren't interested. Nevertheless, we didn't push harder. That's why they still haven't supported the native token. However, in the future, when we get listed on better and bigger exchanges, we will include the native $STOS or even future trading as part of the package and request for them to make it happen.</p>"},{"location":"stratos-ama-twitter-spaces-12-02-2024/#about-7007-studio","title":"About 7007 Studio","text":"<p>Speaker</p> <p>Can you tell us about Studio 7007, please?</p> <p>Bin</p> <p>Actually, we met each other in January, and then we had extensive discussions. One of the topics we delved into was data management - how people can retain ownership of their own content and how they can get rewarded for sharing that data with AI models. This idea was something we brought up during our conversations, and Seven had a very similar concept because they wanted to place all AI models on the chain. I also had a conversation with them this morning, so we've been working closely together recently. I really appreciate their approach, and I mentioned that it's probably the right approach to try decentralized AI.</p> <p>Regarding AI, I like to think of it as having three different parties involved. The first party consists of data scientists who work on AI models, designing and training them. The second party includes those who provide clean or valuable data. Lastly, the third party comprises those who use the trained AI models to earn money or for real use cases. The first two parties are contributors, and both of them should be compensated. However, the third party is the one that will make a business out of it, earn money, and pay these two contributors.</p> <p>Currently, people often think that since they have a GPU and an AI model (which is often open source), they don't need to pay the contributors who created the model, nor do they need to pay for data since it's freely available on platforms like Google or social media. This mentality could change soon. The economic model needs to be more balanced, and free data may not be sustainable in the long run. AI models are resource-intensive and expensive to develop. OpenAI, for example, is seeking $7 trillion for this endeavor.</p> <p>It's easy to appreciate a beautiful picture or image in GameFi or NFT, but when it comes to infrastructure, like decentralized storage, it's challenging because people are quick to criticize. They can easily determine if it's garbage or not based on usage. However, with NFTs, value is subjective, and people may have different perspectives on what's valuable. Infrastructure projects face a uniform challenge in terms of perception.</p> <p>When people work on decentralized storage and infrastructure, it's challenging. We want people to recognize its value, even if it's not perfect yet. Seeing more nodes and new participants in the network is encouraging because it shows that they are okay with our technology. While we may not be perfect, compared to other projects, we're doing well. AI will undergo a similar process. Currently, people may judge AI projects as good or bad, but once they start using them, they'll truly understand their effectiveness.</p>"},{"location":"stratos-ama-twitter-spaces-12-02-2024/#team-and-roadmap-on-site","title":"Team and Roadmap on Site","text":"<p>Speaker</p> <p>Why did the team and the roadmap were removed from the website?</p> <p>Bin</p> <p>Yeah, actually, we haven't removed anything from the website. The previous roadmap has already been accomplished. However, the next significant milestone involves the completion of the computation components and the decentralized database. It's challenging to estimate when these components will be ready. While the storage and blockchain were ready last year, predicting the readiness of the computation components and the database is much more uncertain.</p> <p>The reason we haven't included these milestones on the website is that without specific dates, they might not appear very serious. However, it's important to note that the previous milestones have been completed, which is why we removed them from the website.</p> <p>Regarding the computation components, when we started, we realized they may never be fully ready. We have a different approach compared to projects like ICP or Flux. Instead of providing a container for users to do anything they want, we want to create a marketplace similar to the Apple Store. Users can select components for their specific needs, such as encoding or decoding media, or working on APIs. We want to offer a variety of computing components based on business requirements, and we also want third parties to contribute their own components to the marketplace.</p> <p>When the marketplace is ready, we want people to have access to it, but it will be an ongoing process. We want to continuously add new components to process data on the storage.</p> <p>As for the decentralized database, the strategy will be different, and it will take even longer to develop. Eventually, we aim for the database to hold most public chain information, allowing users to query it directly without running their own node. This will help build trust as the information on the database will be traceable and unmodifiable, ensuring consistency across all users.</p> <p>While we don't have a specific timeline for these developments, it's our long-term goal. Stratos is a long-term project, and we're committed to delivering solid progress step by step. We're cautious not to rush each step and risk compromising our reputation. You can track our progress on GitHub, where we're continuously merging new code and making updates.</p> <p>Speaker</p> <p>Your team's doing an amazing job. What about the team on the website where are the pictures of the team on the website.</p> <p>Bin</p> <p>Okay, yes, that was my decision. I felt that we no longer needed to display the team members on our platform. Many of our members have been with us for over two years, and we've built a strong and stable team. With increasing regulatory scrutiny, some team members expressed concerns about having their personal information associated with a crypto project. We believe that our product should speak for itself, rather than relying on personal information or previous work experience to establish credibility. Therefore, we made the decision to stop displaying our team information.</p> <p>However, if you conduct your own research on platforms like LinkedIn, Twitter, or in various communities, you'll find that our team members are still active. They are engaged in discussions on Twitter, Telegram channels, and Discord, providing ample opportunities for communication.</p> <p>Furthermore, you can also reach out to me directly. While I understand that some people may not agree with this approach, I believe it's not a significant issue.

When I was saying about us getting into all these surveys that say about all the DePIN projects, and there seems to be projects with less of a market cap that ours are always in it like cross network and it's always in these sectors. But we're higher market cap and we're nowhere to be seen. We might be in only a few of them.</p> <p>Bin</p> <p>Yes, I understand. There are indeed larger institutional organizations that conduct DeFi promotions. They often feature projects like Filecoin in their narratives, given Filecoin's longstanding presence in the market. Another factor is their higher market capitalization and larger community membership, with more token holders. </p> <p>However, it's important to note that getting involved with these organizations typically requires some level of fame and financial contribution. While Stratos has been around for over two years, we're still relatively small compared to these entities. If they're not willing to feature us without payment, it's not a major concern for us, as Stratos prioritizes being a product-driven project.</p> <p>We're committed to showcasing our product and engaging with more communities and projects to highlight our strengths and why we offer a superior solution compared to older projects. However, we're not inclined to spend a significant amount of money for this purpose. </p> <p>While it's common for projects to pay for mentions in articles and content, we prefer to demonstrate our value organically, step by step. If it makes sense for us to invest resources in certain opportunities, we'll certainly consider it, but we won't do so blindly. If some organizations choose not to feature us without payment, that's fine. </p> <p>We believe that our strength and growth will speak for themselves over time. As for our involvement with AI, we're actively collaborating in this field because it's a transparent way to demonstrate our capabilities. Unlike paying for visibility, working with AI requires us to prove the quality and performance of our project through actual usage. </p> <p>This approach aligns with our philosophy of earning recognition through merit rather than financial investment.</p>"},{"location":"stratos-ama-twitter-spaces-12-02-2024/#android-wallet","title":"Android Wallet","text":"<p>Claire</p> <p>The first question we have that do we plan to create a Stratos Android wallet for easier transfer of $STOS tokens also via the Stratos network because Ethereum is very expensive.</p> <p>Bin</p> <p>We have a partnership with a third party who claims to have developed an Android and iOS mobile wallet.

We've been in communication with them approximately every two weeks, and in our recent discussions, they shared their code base with us and sought advice on the best way to integrate with Stratos. We provided them with guidance, and I plan to follow up with them next week to check on their progress. Once they feel they are ready to integrate with Stratos storage and begin storing AI data on our platform, I will keep you all updated.</p> <p>From my perspective, I believe that initially, they may intend to establish their own storage subnet, but this process may not be straightforward.

So here is a question from the telegram community. So who pays the ozone for users to watch the content while miner receive a part of the ozone paid to upload or download the data?</p> <p>Bin</p> <p>Yes, that question has been addressed. We're currently focusing on developing the CDN layer. With the CDN layer in place, business users can pay for bandwidth so that others can access their content, similar to how viewers watch videos on platforms like YouTube without paying directly. However, for users who opt to access content directly from the Stratos storage layer without using the CDN, they will pay for their own bandwidth usage. This payment, although minimal, is made directly by users who already have wallets connected to the Stratos network.</p> <p>In terms of rewards, content creators receive two types of rewards. Firstly, there's the mining reward, which comes from the token economics of the mining pool.

Prior to that, we utilized a WeChat channel for Stratos. However, due to stringent cryptocurrency regulations imposed by the Chinese government, WeChat is not deemed the most suitable platform for discussing crypto-related matters. As a result, we've discontinued the use of the WeChat channel. We strongly advise our community members to use Telegram instead.</p> <p>The concern stems from the fact that WeChat users often link their personal phone numbers to their accounts. In the event of government crackdowns on cryptocurrencies, this could potentially expose individuals who are part of WeChat channels related to crypto discussions.

We're thrilled to announce that some exciting new features are on the horizon, with the possibility of launching them in March on our testnets. Once thoroughly tested and ready, these features will be rolled out on the mainnet. While each of these features may not individually revolutionize the game, collectively they represent significant advancements for Stratos.</p> <p>Furthermore, we're gearing up to embark on small AI projects and initiate work on our computing component. These are monumental undertakings for us. So, I urge you to stay tuned and continue to journey with us as we unveil more exciting news throughout the year. Thank you all once again for your unwavering support.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"stratos-ama-twitter-spaces-27-10-2023/","title":"AMA on Twitter 27.10.2023","text":""},{"location":"stratos-ama-twitter-spaces-27-10-2023/#welcomes","title":"Welcomes","text":"<p>Claire</p> <p>All right, hello everyone. Welcome to another Stratos community AMA on Twitter space. This is Claire, very nice to meet everyone again. So we get it here today after the very exciting Stratos mean at launch. And we couldn't be more thrilled to discuss all the significant milestones and everything related to the overall Stratos ecosystem development in the near future.</p> <p>So before we dive into the question period now, we would like to begin with some updates given by our founder, Bin, related to the performance overall after the mainnet launch, some questions that you might be interested in regards to what are some of the plans in terms of partners in a pipeline and etc. So if you're ready lets dive in and give the floor to Bin.</p>"},{"location":"stratos-ama-twitter-spaces-27-10-2023/#updates","title":"Updates","text":"<p>Bin</p> <p>Hi Claire, thank you. I will just give you guys a bit of basic updates. I rather give most of the time to the community to ask any question in your mind. Maybe I can talk more at the that moment.</p> <p>So as you know, our Stratos chain and storage network were launched more than a month ago. Everything is going well, actually it's better than we expected. The chain is very stable, we have around 50 validators, there are 28 validators are online. We have done some estimation, most of the validators, especially the professional validator service providers, they should be profitable. This is important for Stratos. I think we're excited to see that result. </p> <p>The other side is storage. I just mentioned on Twitter yesterday, we already have more than 250 storage nodes are online. Actually, there are several more added to the Stratos network this morning. So the total storage capacity for Stratos is already exceeded to 2 PB, the feeling is wonderful. </p> <p>The team upgraded SDS version and tuned some configuration in this month. All the changes' modification are based on the performance, no any big issues were founded. We optimized configurations on the storage side, most of the storage providers provide decent hardware and qualified bandwidth to the storage network, but there are still small portion of nodes' bandwidth and hardware not qualified. Those unqualified nodes affect the entire network somehow. So most of the configurations and most changes we made, are trying to get rid of the unqualified nodes out of the network. Next week, the performance will even better when the new rules and new configurations are applied to the network. </p> <p>That's some updates. Let the community ask questions. </p>"},{"location":"stratos-ama-twitter-spaces-27-10-2023/#storage-network-dashboard","title":"Storage Network Dashboard","text":"<p>Claire</p> <p>I suggest that will prioritize everyone who is online with us. If you have any questions, please feel free to raise your hand or just simply click the mic and we will invite you onto the stage. If we do not have anyone here with questions, then we do have a list of questions from the community that we can just ask one by one. But still, let's see if there's anyone here that has some questions to ask.</p> <p>While we are giving them some time maybe I can start by proposing one question from the community.</p> <p>So first of all, when can we expect the release of the dashboard displaying real time statistics and insights into the utilization and performance of the Stratos network?</p> <p>Bin</p> <p>We had a dashboard ticket and the developers worked on that already. To be honest, this requirement is not a high priority right now. Make sure the network is stable, getting rid of the low performance node are more important for Stratos. So after we make sure the network is in good shape, we will go back to work on the dashboard requirement. It's hard to estimate how long it will take, but hopefully, we can see the first version of the dashboard next month.</p> <p>Claire</p> <p>So it's mostly based on the overall performance of the network, right? As to when we will launch a presentable dashboard for everyone to view the network\u2019s data performance.</p> <p>Bin</p> <p>Thank you. The network\u2019s data performance is one dimension on the dashboard, all the SDS node owners will be able to use this dashboard to monitor their nodes as well.</p>"},{"location":"stratos-ama-twitter-spaces-27-10-2023/#application-to-use-the-storage-network","title":"Application to use the Storage Network","text":"<p>Claire</p> <p>The second question is when can users expect a consumer facing application that enables upload and download of files and streaming of videos? </p> <p>Bin</p> <p>We haven't launched it yet because we want to make sure the entire storage network is in good shape first. For the videos stream function, later on, users can use Stratos Wallet or 3rd parties dAPPs to do it. Currently, we have two 3rd parties are cooperating with us with Stratos grants. In the future, the end user will have multiple options to upload/download files. Later, you can probably watch videos directly from the dAPPs.</p>"},{"location":"stratos-ama-twitter-spaces-27-10-2023/#stratos-wallet-for-iosandroid","title":"Stratos wallet for iOS/Android","text":"<p>Claire</p> <p>It's good to know that our internal Stratos team is working on the architecture part, and there are external parties who will be working on the UI or more user friendly apps to support this.</p> <p>Speaking about the wallet, we do have another question about when we will have the IOS, android, or Web wallet.</p> <p>Bin</p> <p>Currently, the wallets created by Stratos team are mostly based on the desktop for macOS, Linux and Windows. But the 3rd party team works on the mobile wallet. They have already submitted mobile Wallet to Google Play Store, and the process status is undergoing auditing at the moment. It will be available on the Google Play Store when it's done.</p>"},{"location":"stratos-ama-twitter-spaces-27-10-2023/#status-of-grant-program","title":"Status of grant program","text":"<p>Claire</p> <p>You mentioned previously that there are two teams that are already working on different kinds of applications on top of the Stratos ecosystem. Can you give me more information about what is the current status of the grant program? Maybe more details about the number of applicants, as well as the projects that have successfully progressed to the next stage.</p> <p>Bin</p> <p>We already approved two teams' grants. One is working on the mobile wallet, Android is first, IOS will be the next. Later, they may also work on some UIs on the mobile app to allow the community to upload and download files.</p> <p>The other team actually has some experience in the decentralized Storage field.  They have already built great dAPPs based on the IPFS and Filecoin. Right now they are interested in Stratos as well, so they want to build a brand-new application upon the Stratos network.</p> <p>We have been in contact with a 3rd team. They may build some domain services on Stratos. We have received around roughly 20 applications with different proposals, some applications are still under the reviewing process now. </p>"},{"location":"stratos-ama-twitter-spaces-27-10-2023/#strategic-partnerships","title":"Strategic partnerships","text":"<p>Claire</p> <p>I can ensure that we will review all of the grant applications carefully. We do want to select the serious builders to build on top of Stratos and to best utilize this grant. We're still promoting the grant program to reach different kinds of developers. We want to attract other builders to apply for it.</p> <p>Could you share some insights about the strategic partnership Stratos is planning to establish to enhance the adoption of the decentralized storage network?</p> <p>Bin</p> <p>We have two types of partnerships. One which we already established before we launched the mainnet. We are going back to revisit all the partners we announced. We will go back to those teams and will provide all the technical documents, and let them know what the Stratos is capable to do.</p> <p>After they receive the information, they will decide when they probably will work on that, or when they will work on the migrations. This is out of our control, and I think they may most likely also need some help from our team. When they are ready to start using Stratos, then they will let us know. That's the partnership we had established before the mainnet.</p> <p>Meanwhile, we are looking for some new partnerships. We work closely with VC network, the Twitter X network, and social networks. We will discuss with  traditional businesses and crypto business projects together. Some showcases and demos show what Stratos network could do and why they should choose Stratos.</p>"},{"location":"stratos-ama-twitter-spaces-27-10-2023/#exchanges","title":"Exchanges","text":"<p>Claire</p> <p>Thank you for the transparency and update.</p> <p>The next question is in regards to exchange listing. Are there any upcoming listings of the STOS token on major exchanges, and if so, can you provide any specific details or timeline regarding these listings?</p> <p>Bin</p> <p>Listing on exchanges is tricky. This is one of the most frequent questions discussed in the community. To be honest, we had communicated with some exchanges about listing $STOS. But I have to say that those exchanges were not top exchanges, not top ten exchanges. After some communication with exchanges between top 10 to 30, the team found the liquidity of some small coins like Stratos (low market cap) performance are not good as well on those exchanges. </p> <p>So some small exchanges, especially in the current situation, they won't help to improve the liquidity of $STOS. They will even further divide liquidity from current exchanges, which is even worse. So thus, we have not been prioritizing listing to new exchanges under the top ten right now.</p> <p>We want to dedicate our efforts to gate.io first. We will work on Gate and try to provide more liquidity on gate. Gate has already supported Stratos mainnet. You can deposit native $STOS already. Later, we really would like to list the token on some decent exchanges. Maybe some exchange in Korea, some top exchange, like OKX, Kucoin or later if possible we also like Binance, Coinbase and Kraken. We like to be partners of the top exchanges which really can help with the liquidity. But for the lower ranking exchanges, we are not that interested in the current situation.</p>"},{"location":"stratos-ama-twitter-spaces-27-10-2023/#total-used-space-for-storage","title":"Total used space for storage","text":"<p>Claire</p> <p>Back to the storage network, how much storage space has been allocated and utilized on the Stratos network since its launch? and are there any projections for its expansion in the near future.</p> <p>Bin</p> <p>It's not hard for us to estimate how much storage is used, but we haven't run the analytics process for checking storage usage in real time yet. We could get the information on how much data is stored via the Metanodes. That will be one feature of the Storage dashboard of the storage network when we launch it. Everyone can check by themselves.</p>"},{"location":"stratos-ama-twitter-spaces-27-10-2023/#development-roadmap","title":"Development Roadmap","text":"<p>Claire</p> <p>So could you please provide some information about the development roadmap for Stratos over the next twelve months, highlighting any major milestones or key objectives the team is aiming to achieve?</p> <p>Bin</p> <p>I think the plan has never changed. Like I said before, since Stratos blockchain and storage network mainnet were launched, we won't rush to work on the second component, like the computing component or database component. We really want more people to use the storage first, encourage the community to store the data on our Stratos.</p> <p>So when the storage network is satisfied and usage is higher , we will start to launch the second component. But we don't have a detailed plan to announce. We need to observe how it's going with the storage first, how many nodes participate and how many users, how many businesses have stored the data on the storage network. That will be the trigger for us to move on.</p> <p>Meanwhile, we cooperate with 3rd parties, like grants applicants or other 3rd parties who want to participate in our storage network. The team will probably separately on some side projects or dAPPs to bring much more traffic to Stratos storage. </p> <p>Another plan based on Stratos storage is related to our unique consensus algorithm called Proof of Traffic. Proof of Traffic means for any SDS node, the more traffic you provide, then the more $STOS you will earn. The next big idea which is made possible by Proof of Traffic is the ability to reward content producers.</p> <p>Let me provide you an example similar to what Twitter X does. The more views and likes an X post receives, meaning you promote more traffic on the platform, the more X rewards you.  They share a portion of their revenue with you. With Stratos, you can do the same thing as well.</p> <p>It means that we can create a mechanism where content providers who have good videos/audios/any contents that attract people, and generate traffic, can be rewarded with a share of the traffic revenue. The content producer can upload their content to Stratos network  to receive the traffic revenue share. </p> <p>For example, if you produce a video and upload it to Stratos network, then plenty of people download and watch it, imagine how much traffic you may generate. This could be petabytes of traffic. How much reward will you get? It would be a huge amount. With this feature, the content providers are encouraged to upload high-quality content with incentive, and SDS node providers will also get benefit from the traffic is generated by the content providers.</p> <p>When we launch this program, the Stratos will probably attract some YouTubers or other content producers. They will receive much more reward compared to if they uploaded to YouTube or upload to X. So this will most likely be a big thing for Stratos. I think it is a exciting feature we will launch soon. You may upload one piece of content, then may receive 10 $STOS, or hundreds $STOS in the following day or month.</p> <p>Contents rewards program is a unique feature that will be launched by Stratos compared with any of the other storage service providers such as Arweave, Filecoin or any others. None of them support this feature. Stratos has that because Stratos was born for that. Stratos was born for hot data, and hot data is data with traffic. And where does the traffic come from? From good content. Share to earn will be a fully organic program of Stratos. </p>"},{"location":"stratos-ama-twitter-spaces-27-10-2023/#how-file-slices-work","title":"How file slices work","text":"<p>Claire</p> <p>Thank you for sharing this very exciting new features that will be added to the Stratos Storage network, which will also enable developers who are interested in building any kind of content creation type apps.</p> <p>Another question we have in regards to the technical specifications of Stratos is how many slices a file gets split up into by default? What's the size of the slice? And also how many copies of those slices are stored on the network.</p> <p>Bin</p> <p>Currently, for a general file, each of the slices is 30 MB. We did some tests and 30 MB is an optimal number for each slice. To make sure it's balanced. We don't want too many slices for each file, we also don't want each slice too big or too small. </p> <p>If it's a video, the slice size will be a little smaller. It is around 10 MB. Because when we play the video on Stratos, they will cost more CPUs, so we want to have more parallel processes at the same time. </p> <p>If you have a 100mb file to upload, your file will be separated into 4 slices, and each of the slice will have 5 replications, so your file will have five copies distributed on the Stratos storage network. </p> <p>If any copies of these slices are lost, or any server is offline, and you lose one slice, Stratos Metanodes will aware of it when you access it. Then the Metanode will create another copy to replace the lost one. Funds from the offline SDS node\u2019s wallet will be charged to pay for the traffic needed to create another copy. </p>"},{"location":"stratos-ama-twitter-spaces-27-10-2023/#chain-explorer-update","title":"Chain explorer update","text":"<p>Claire</p> <p>Thanks for explaining that. For the folks who still have questions in regards to this topic, feel free to continue discussing this in telegram and that might be easier to explain through text with numbers and examples.</p> <p>Another question we have is in regards to the new website along with the update of the Blockchain Explorer displaying data regarding APR and market cap. Can you give an update on this?</p> <p>Bin</p> <p>Actually, we will launch the new Big-Dipper explorer very soon. From the new Big-Dipper explorer, you can see the circulation and market cap. You also can check the different transactions including transfer file and volume report. The new explorer will show you much more detail information than the current version.</p> <p>Meanwhile, we will contact Coingecko and CoinMarketCap and offer the API to them. Hopefully, they could integrate the new API soon, so we can see the current circulation supply and market cap in the real time. </p>"},{"location":"stratos-ama-twitter-spaces-27-10-2023/#new-website","title":"New website","text":"<p>Claire</p> <p>And I can also add a little bit in regards to the new website. The overall development is nearly finalized and we're just reviewing some new content. We are also waiting for the latest version of the Explorer that will be able to sync up with the new website. So hopefully probably in a month or so we will be able to have the new website. </p> <p>Does anyone have any question that you would like to raise and discuss in real time with us here today on Twitter space?</p> <p>Hello, Jim.</p>"},{"location":"stratos-ama-twitter-spaces-27-10-2023/#how-to-use-stratos-storage","title":"How to use Stratos storage","text":"<p>Speaker</p> <p>And I just wanna, I just wanna ask a question right, you know, i'm not very technical or anything like that. For like newcomers what exactly the Stratos do? What's it gonna do in the future? I know you got a blockchain and storage. What exactly can people do on it? Just so I can get a better understanding.</p> <p>Bin</p> <p>All kinds of businesses need storage, like human being need the air and water. How can we promote Stratos to make them feel comfortable and trustable to use Stratos? For the end user, easy use is important. The third party and our team are working on the dAPPs so any user can have their wallet, log in based on their credentials, upload their video, audio or photo, or any data.</p> <p>Then we also want people to be able to watch or listen to the music from that as well. That's for the end user. This will be an alternative to Dropbox or Google Drive.</p> <p>The other major case of Stratos is enterprise usage. Large companies want to store sensitive information or their users' privacy information. Sometimes, due to regulations, they cannot use the public cloud. They need to build their own private cloud. This is where Stratos could be an option for them. </p> <p>For crypto projects like NFTs, GameFi, or even some blockchain projects where their blockchain is too big to keep all the blocks online. They may choose to store some previous blocks offline.</p> <p>Stratos Storage has many use cases. We need to target those above-mentioned different sectors to work with them to help them. We have to promote trust in Stratos and convert them to be our customers. So that will be the long-term goal. We will do everything step by step to grow the Stratos business.</p>"},{"location":"stratos-ama-twitter-spaces-27-10-2023/#ar-fl-comparison","title":"AR / FL comparison","text":"<p>Speaker</p> <p>What comparison are we to Arweave and Filecoin? And what about ICP? Are they all similar? or Can Stratos do more?</p> <p>Bin</p> <p>I think Stratos is better, Stratos performance is better than Arweave and Filecoin. </p> <p>In the tokenomic side, Stratos consensus is Proof of Traffic, users pay based on the traffic. Unlike Arweave, where you just pay once, and you get \u201cpermanent storage\u201d (~200 years). I don't believe in the pay once model because that kind of service never exists in the real world. I don't think that could ever exist. Maybe that one payment can store that file for a couple of years\u2026 but \u201cpermanent storage\u201d is just not practical. </p> <p>For Filecoin, I feel Stratos is more reliable. The reason is if any of your nodes, and a part of your data was lost because some nodes are offline, Stratos can help to recover it automatically. </p> <p>But on Filecoin, that does not happen. They don't have that functionality in their core storage protocol. All files uploaded are dependent on Filecoin miners. They will decide what kind of file they want to store. You only can encourage them, but if they just don't want to continue storing the file, it will be lost. So on Filecoin and IPFS we cannot 100% guarantee that a file will be available or not.</p> <p>Filecoin tries to solve that by increasing the reward for some Filecoin miners, but they still have the fundamental issues because IPFS protocol architecture is fundamentally different to Stratos. So I feel that they have fundamental issues regarding reliability. Stratos solves that issue of data resiliency.</p> <p>ICP, Internet Computer, mostly provides the computing power not storage. They have recently realized without storage their computing power cannot do much. Recently, they are trying to add storage, but they are not a storage network. The ICP nodes provide computing power with very limited storage. ICP also works very differently. Their network only has 21 nodes, it doesn't matter what you save to their ICP. You are using ICP network they only have 21 nodes for you. It's not a hundred. Not a thousand. Only 21. ICP is picky with their miners as well. They don't have many miners in the network. If you want to be the miner providing computing service to ICP, you need to provide a very high-performance computer.  Stratos network is purely decentralized, ICP is not. So I would rather not say they're worse, or we are better.</p> <p>With Stratos all your data will be distributed to hundreds of nodes, not only to about 21. Stratos distributes multiple copies of your files to different geographical locations. Asia, Europe, North America, everywhere. So we, that's why we feel we are more safe and we are more decentralized.</p> <p>In the future, when we launch the computing component, Stratos will be able to directly process the data you store in Stratos storage network. At that time, we could provide very similar functionality like ICP can do now.</p>"},{"location":"stratos-ama-twitter-spaces-27-10-2023/#stratos-and-ai","title":"Stratos and AI","text":"<p>Speaker</p> <p>What do you think about Arweave having other blockchains\u2019 historical data and AI data stored upon it? Can we have the same? Will other blockchains start using us?</p> <p>Bin</p> <p>Actually, AI and blockchain are two different things. Before I created Stratos, I was a technical cofounder of an AI company. I know how AI works. To be honest, I feel many AI projects in the market cannot work out because they're just trying to re-use some idle GPUs that come from Ethereum mining machines to make some cash.</p> <p>What GPU is good at? GPU is good at the floating-point arithmetic, which is needed by AI computation requirements heavily. But only GPUs could work out? I highly doubt that. </p> <p>Most of the AI projects mention how many GPUs they have. But AI can't work out only with GPU. To train the models, AI requests huge amount of data. You can do the research on ChatGPT or any big AI company, You will see they are not only building their powerful GPU data center. GPU computation power can accelerate AI process, but only huge amounts of data can make AI smarter.</p> <p>Without the data, it doesn't matter how many GPUs you have, that AI is still not smart. So without the data, only GPU power, there are not many cases the AI project could do.  That's why I don't feel the most AI projects make sense to me. Some AI projects mine tokens via GPU computation power. But how could companies use the GPUs? I don't know how they can ingest the data to the GPU. Where the data is stored, where the GPU reads the data from. </p> <p>The second thing, people only care about the GPUs. But most people don't know the GPU is limited because the GPU can only do floating-point arithmetic. In the AI process, they need to do lots of logic process, which can only be done by CPU. If you do your research on AWS or Google Cloud AI infrastructure, you will realize there are powerful CPUs are mandatory for AI servers. That's why I feel most of the GPU mining AI tokens doesn't make sense for me. </p> <p>A general Ethereum mining machine is combined 6 GPUs with a lower performance CPU/motherboard/HDD hard disk because the simple hash rate algorithm for mining Ethereum doesn't need much CPU and disk to cooperate. But this kind of mining machine could contribute computing power value to complicated AI algorithms? I don't think so. </p> <p>Any way, that's all my opinion, please you guys can just do your research.</p> <p>Speaker</p> <p>Thank you. I trust your project. I love it. I think it's such a transparency, and I'm so excited to be on this journey with you. Thank you.</p>"},{"location":"stratos-ama-twitter-spaces-27-10-2023/#content-creatos-and-stratos","title":"Content creatos and Stratos","text":"<p>Claire</p> <p>I saw another question in regards to the feature that you just mentioned for content creators. So how is Stratos going to make it clear that YouTubers and so on, they can actually get more rewards if they do it on Stratos network. Do we have a number?</p> <p>Bin</p> <p>I don't have a number, I'll just give you an example. If there is a YouTubers, he has 100,000 followers and each of the followers watch the video. So when this YouTuber uploads 100 MB video, this video will be watched for 100,000 times, so this video generates 10 TB traffic. This is giant traffic. Even only the X% traffic of 10 TB that YouTube received is still huge. </p> <p>That's what YouTuber will get, this is a pure organic reward. In Web2 industry, Youtube or X only give the content producer a very small portion of their reward based on how many ads impressions. That's how big company make money. But Stratos network works different, all the reward for the content producer comes from the followers directly. That is huge, no any middle man who cut big part of the reward. It's a different business model. Stratos reward program model is similar to OnlyFans. You guys know OnlyFans, right? So similarly, you can create content to show people how to cook, how to do exercise. The followers pay the subscription fee. </p> <p>With Stratos reward program, both of content producers or followers are anonymous, no KYC, no email, and no credit card, it is a purely Web3 content sharing network. More important, all the traffics and rewards are fully transparency that I think this is most of the powerful part of Stratos.</p>"},{"location":"stratos-ama-twitter-spaces-27-10-2023/#new-round-of-fundraising","title":"New round of fundraising","text":"<p>Claire</p> <p>Thanks, Bin.

Greate to meet all you guys tonight My name is Bin Zhu, founder of Stratos</p> <p>Blake Ling, [4/21/2022 5:03 AM] Hi Bin! For those that are not familiar, can you briefly describe Stratos and what problems you are aiming to solve?</p> <p>Bin Zhu, [4/21/2022 5:04 AM] Stratos is a decentralized infrastructure project which provides scalable, reliable, self-balanced storage, database, and computation network. Stratos is born for scaling blockchain process capacity while retaining the decentralized benefits of a distributed protocol including trustless, traceability, variability, privacy, etc. Stratos provides decentralized Cloud services to the blockchain industry and traditional industry as well to reduce the complex issues when developer work on the decentralized world. Stratos invented a new consensus Proof of Traffic which means all the miner\u2019s rewards really depend on the traffics they served.</p> <p>Blake Ling, [4/21/2022 5:06 AM] Sounds impressive! Can you elaborate on the differences with Proof of traffic compared to POW or other consensus?</p> <p>Bin Zhu, [4/21/2022 5:06 AM] Thanks, that\u2019s a great question PoW: Proof of Work, the hashrate, computation power to calculate the hashcode PoS (Filecoin): Proof of Storage There are 2 points to compare with different consensus</p> <p>1. Economy PoW and PoS are the similar to the traditional business. Calculate more hash code, Store more data like transport more goods via the truck to make more money. But in the Internet business, traffic not storage, more traffic, more eyeball, more attention, more advertiser profit. So traffic is the most important measurement for value.</p> <p>2. Network health and performance Proof of Storage will only encourage miner to keep increase the storage size instead of the mining machine performance. That\u2019s the major reason the Filecoin network performance is not that good, the uploading/downloading speed are not good as well.</p> <p>Proof of Traffic cares the entire mining machine performance instead of any single part. If the performance of the mining machine is bad, the miner can\u2019t earn much reward, the miner is encouraged to maintain the machines. Stratos believe, the only way to keep the network in the good shape is keeping each of node of network in the good shape.</p> <p>So PoT is better and more health consensus than PoW and Proof of Storage of Filecoin.</p> <p>Blake Ling, [4/21/2022 5:10 AM] How does the STOS token function within the platform and why is it needed?</p> <p>Bin Zhu, [4/21/2022 5:11 AM] Users of the Stratos network are debited STOS tokens based on their volume of data moved through the network. The Proof-of-Traffic algorithm transparently charges the user based on indisputable transaction records recorded on the Stratos Blockchain.</p> <p>STOS token utilities:</p> <ul> <li>STOS will be staked/delegated to validators to secure the Blockchain network. </li> <li>STOS will be issued as Proof-of-Traffic mining reward. </li> <li>STOS will be consumed in the payment of the transaction fee. </li> <li>STOS will be prepaid for Stratos Resource Network service traffic fee.</li> </ul> <p>The current status Market cap = 25M Fixed supply =100M Circulation supply =27M Mining allocation =40% for (68.8 Years)</p> <p>BTW, all the early investors tokens were released already</p> <p>Blake Ling, [4/21/2022 5:16 AM] Could you share the development status and progress of the project thus far? Including the major partners and perhaps some operational data.</p> <p>Bin Zhu, [4/21/2022 5:17 AM] Stratos delivered 1. Stratos blockchain testnet 2. Stratos Storage tesetnet 3. Stratos Storage incentive testnet 4. Stratos Wallet desktop version for Windows, IOS and Linux</p> <p>There are more than 50K Storage nodes participate the testnet, uploading/downloading performance is very good. It only take around 7 seconds to upload the 200MB file.</p> <p>We already built lots of partnership. For the future, there are more and more projects could take advantage of Stratos services.</p> <p>For example, Stratos decentralized Storage and CDN, SoMee works with us very close and integrate their platform on Stratos. The NTF projects will realize Stratos storage is more suitable solution for them.</p> <p>DeFi, GameFi, Metaverse need the decentralized database for storing user\u2019s profile and system parameters.</p> <p>Decentralized computation will offer difference services, like \u201cVideo Streaming Encoding\u201d, \u201cAPI\u201d, \u201cIoT edging computing\u201d etc.</p> <p>Project Category \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 SoMee SocialFi BoringDao DeFi ColdStack Storage Firework Games GameFi Amy Finance DeFi/NFT Prosper Prediction Markets Coinversation DeFi Bitspawn GameFi Prometeus Labs</p> <p>Blake Ling, [4/21/2022 5:24 AM] Who will the users/clients be on your projects and what are some examples of use cases for them?</p> <p>Bin Zhu, [4/21/2022 5:24 AM] As decentralized cloud service provider, Stratos could provide blockchain, storage, database and computation services separately or combined for any blockchain project or traditional project as well.</p> <p>There are use cases are </p> <p>1. Accelerated Network (Decentralized CDN) Stratos decentralized storage not only allows users to upload and download data efficiently but also allows users to directly play audio or video across the network without downloading it in advance. For every user or developer, this will be an important feature. Developers can use this feature provided by Stratos to make a future \u201cDecentralized YouTube\u201d or \u201cDecentralized Apple Music\u201d possible.</p> <p>IPFS/Filecoin can\u2019t guarantee no data lost Arweave is too slow to use in the real business case.</p> <p>So the most NFT projects are storing the NFT digital assets in 2 differnet places, one in Filecoin/Arweave and the other in centralized storage, such as AWS S3 or Google Storage for accessing efficiently.</p> <p>Stratos high performance decentralized storage will solve this problem.</p> <p>2. Enhanced Oracle Stratos decentralized database can help to build a new Oracle platform. In terms of data security, which is what people are most concerned about, Stratos does not rely on economic punishment to prevent nodes from evil-doing, like other oracles, but can fundamentally use technology to directly ensure that the data cannot be tampered with. In terms of data structure, Stratos completely removes the limitation that the blockchain on the market can only store ledger information. The Stratos decentralized database can support a more diverse data structure and can better collect data of different dimensions from different sources to perform cross calculations to ensure the credibility and richness of the final data output.</p> <p>3. Decentralized Social Media The key to decentralized social media is equal rights between accounts and the ownership of each account\u2019s data. Stratos\u2019s decentralized database can fully guarantee equal rights and data ownership, and prevents the centralized voice from drowning out the voice of any personal account.</p> <p>4. Edge Computing and IoT Stratos not only encourages small data centres to access the network as a whole but also welcomes individual nodes to access the network to provide decentralized computing services. Small data centres can form the backbone of the Stratos network, the information highway, and individual nodes are the branches and leaves of the highway. Although the computing power of individual nodes is limited, individual nodes can take advantage of the low latency of the network to provide users around the node with edge computing services required by smart appliances, smart home networking, and industrial IoT devices.</p> <p>Blake Ling, [4/21/2022 5:31 AM] What is your strategy regarding attracting more users to your protocol?</p> <p>Bin Zhu, [4/21/2022 5:32 AM] Stratos is a decentralized infrastructure service provider, so most strategy for blockchain developer to show Stratos capabilities, solid, easy to use and entire service package instead of building your dApp among multiple complicated services. For traditional business, such as Video/Stream website, Stratos will offer very competitive (90% off) price to them for using Stratos decentralized CDN services. So the price will be the way to open the door of traditional business.</p> <p>Blake Ling, [4/21/2022 5:37 AM] Let\u2019s talk about the current landscape of other projects doing something similar. What separates you from some of the competitors?</p> <p>Bin Zhu, [4/21/2022 5:38 AM] Let\u2019s talk about 2 cases</p> <p>Computation part: ICP and some other decentralized computation project would like to provide the computation container like docker, but in the most case the container is too flexible to use.</p> <p>Stratos computation will take the different way, we will deliver the computation business case by case, for example Video stream encoding service, special IoT computation services. Stratos also would like to cooperate with community, deliver more computation case together on Stratos decentralized computation. The Stratos decentralized computation will be similar to the App store, choose the one you need.</p> <p>Storage part, comparison between Filecoin and Stratos</p> <p>The biggest different between Stratos Storage and Filecoin is the Concensus, Proof of Traffic and Proof of Storage. Please let me do a quick comparison from 2 sides.</p> <p>1. Economy In the traditional business, capacity is the way to measure the value or reward, for example a bigger truck can transport more goods than a small one, so it can earn more. But in the Internet time, capacity is not an efficient way to measure the value any more. More traffic, more eyeball, more attention, more advertiser profit. No any internet companies mention they are the biggest one who own the most data, they only tell the market how much traffic they have per day per hour. So in the Internet industry, Storage is not the measurement of value, but the traffic is.</p> <p>2. Network health and performance Proof of Storage encourages the miner to enlarge the storage to earn more File coin, but doesn't care the performance of mining machine much. Proof of Traffic is very relevant to the performance of an entire mining machine instead of any single component such as computation or storage. So Proof of Traffic will encourage miner to maintain the machine and keep the mining machine also in good shape to earn more.</p> <p>Stratos believe the network performance really depend on each of mining machine performance, if each mining machine performance is good, the entire network performance will be good, otherwise, the network performance won't be good enough to run the business case.</p> <p>Blake Ling, [4/21/2022 5:44 AM] What unique experience does your team bring that puts Stratos in a position to be successful?</p> <p>Bin Zhu, [4/21/2022 5:45 AM] As the founder of Stratos, I have over 20+ years of experience in software development across multiple platforms and technologies. Previously, I was the cloud department founder of MindGeek, where I built the complete big data ecosystem and led the entire team to provide data services to more than 100 millions users per day cross all the country in the world. I was also technical cofounded of Faimdata, an AI company providing consumer data intelligence solutions via computer vision for retailer customers. With experiences working across the generations of technology innovations, I am leading the Stratos team to build the next generation of decentralized data mesh that enables the uses of blockchain technology across industries.</p> <p>Stratos team is formed by a group AAA developers which come from Canadian National Railway, Amazon, Expedia, Huawei, Alibaba etc. Each of them has top enterprise level development experience.</p> <p>Also, there are around 1/3 team members come from the same company Mindgeek like me, they worked with me for building big data platform. Each team member will take advantage of rich developing experience to contribute to the Stratos project</p> <p>Blake Ling, [4/21/2022 5:48 AM] What does success look like for Stratos? What are the biggest risks and challenges Stratos will need to overcome to consider the project successful?</p> <p>Bin Zhu, [4/21/2022 5:48 AM] When massive adoption happens with Stratos, that's the success Stratos is waiting for.</p> <p>Stratos DEV team faces the challenging code/performance/issue every day, but we have confidence to solve all the problem and keep delivery ability.</p> <p>In the market side, we would like to link to major blockchain project and traditional project, cooperate with them, that will be challenge for us in business side. I know it will take time, but we will get them eventually.</p> <p>Blake Ling, [4/21/2022 5:50 AM] How Stratos compare to the centralized cloud?</p> <p>Bin Zhu, [4/21/2022 5:50 AM] AWS the biggest Centralized Cloud provider in the world. It contains lots of complex services which are defined to IaaS, PaaS and SaaS in the different level.</p> <p>Stratos provides 4 different services, blockchain, storage, database and computation which are foundations of decentralized services which we can consider them as Platform as a Service level. On top of those PaaS, Stratos team, communities and collaboration parties will build diversity decentralized software applications (dApp).</p> <p>The availability and experience, to be honest, in the short term, the Stratos can't beat the centralized service provider, like AWS. But Stratos' big advantage are transparency, data ownership and self-developing organically by the user request and incentivization, the most important point is release the freedom voice from people and won't let giant abuse your data and silence your voice.</p> <p>In the long term, with the size of Stratos network bigger and bigger, the availability and experience of Stratos services will be getting better and better, the decentralized provider Stratos will beat AWS and others eventually.</p> <p>KaptinBlack \ud83d\udd74\ud83c\udffd, [4/21/2022 5:51 AM] Hey there Bin \ud83d\udd90\ud83d\udd90</p> <p>Part of the operational Data you provided earlier was \"Stratos Wallet desktop version for Windows, IOS and Linux\"</p> <p>I'd like to know, Why did Startos come up with her own wallet,</p> <p>Also, when compared to other wallets, What are the advantages over other wallets.</p> <p>Are there any special incentives for using the Stratos wallet?</p> <p>Bin Zhu, [4/21/2022 5:54 AM] [In reply to KaptinBlack \ud83d\udd74\ud83c\udffd] Stratos wallet is not only a wallet to store token and execute transactions, Stratos wallet is a entire portal of Stratos ecosystem, it can allow you to upload/download files, also play videos from Stratos wallet directly.</p>"},{"location":"stratos-current-status/","title":"Current Status","text":"<p> Last update: October 21, 2023</p>"},{"location":"stratos-current-status/#roadmap","title":"Roadmap","text":"Date Milestone Status Jun 2021 Stratos Blockchain Testnet Completed Oct 2021 Stratos Storage Testnet Completed Feb 2022 Stratos Incentive Testnet Tropos-1 Completed Mar 2022 Stratos Incentive Testnet Tropos-2 Completed Apr 2022 Stratos Incentive Testnet Tropos-3 Completed Jul 2022 Stratos Incentive Testnet Tropos-4 Completed Jan 2023 Stratos Incentive Testnet Tropos-5 Completed Mar 2023 Security audit with BlockSec [Link] Completed Jul 2023 Mesos Permanent Blockchain Testnet Live Jul 2023 Mesos Permanent Storage Testnet Live Sep 2023 Stratos Blockchain Mainnet Live Sep 2023 Stratos Storage Mainnet Live TBA Stratos Computation Testnet Upcoming TBA Stratos Computation Mainnet Upcoming TBA Stratos Database Testnet Upcoming TBA Stratos Database Mainnet Upcoming"},{"location":"stratos-frequently-asked-questions/","title":"Frequently Asked Questions","text":"<p> Last update: September 21, 2023</p> What is Mesos? <p>Mesos is the name of the Stratos Permanent Testnet, just like Ethereum has its \"Goerli\" testnet.

If anyone would want to upload or download files, he will first need to make a prepay transaction within the Stratos blockchain, basically convert stos to ozone. The amount of ozone purchased will then be used to purchase traffic on the network. At the end of each epoch, the consumed ozone is automatically sold back to the Volume Pool to generate rewards for the resource nodes.</p> Is stratos smart contracts / EVM / AWS S3 compatible? <p>Stratos blockchain supports smart contracts and it's EVM compatible but only partially AWS S3 compatible (with all major features that could satisfy most business cases).</p> Will Stratos join the AI narrative? <p>AI and blockchain technology are two different things. Stratos, as an infrastructure service provider, could offer storage and computing power for AI based applications but other than that, we won't see much of Stratos and AI in the same sentence.</p> How is Stratos decentralized storage different from centralized cloud solutions? <p>Centralized cloud providers like Google/AWS/Azure use custom, high-end servers but that's one of the reasons their services are so expensive. In terms of performance, Stratos will probably not be able to match that in the beginning but once the network becomes more mature and more nodes join the network, the performance will be, at least, comparable.</p> <p>However, Stratos storage selling point is file ownership and security. Being a decentralized provider means that you are the only one that has access to your files, you're not at risk of being censored or your files being deleted for various reasons. Also, the way Stratos storage has been designed, your files are securely stored on the network. Each file is split into multiple pieces, encrypted and stored on different nodes. This means that even if a node breaks encryption, it will only have a portion of your file which will be pretty much useless.</p> <p>Another major selling point for Stratos is storage price. CDN (Content Delivery Network) is a major use case of Stratos so if, for example, websites that stream video through CDN (YouTube, Netflix, TikTok etc) would use Stratos, their storage costs could decrease by 90%.</p> Will projects built on other blockchains be able to switch to Stratos? <p>Yes, projects built on other blockchains can easily embed the Stratos SDK in order to use our storage network, without having to modify their current code. Moreover, projects that currently use IFPS storage can seamlessly migrate to Stratos thanks to IFPS compatibility.</p> <p>If you have a question, you are welcomed to join TG/Discord and ask there.</p>"},{"location":"stratos-miner-handbook/","title":"Stratos Miner Handbook","text":"<p> Last update: Dec 14, 2023</p> <p>DISCLAIMER</p> <ul> <li>This article is NOT part of the official documentation.</li> <li>Think of this as an extended product review written by a fellow node operator after running nodes in mainnet for about two months.</li> <li>Values and predictions used in this article were consistent with the factual circumstances at the time of its writing.

Losing that data in an event of a HDD failure will result in penalties and basically the end of your node. You will need to start over.</p> <p>Sure, scheduled daily backups to a machine in another location is recommended but if you can't do that, at least try to use a RAID setup.</p> <p>If we take as example the Dell Poweredge in the image above, that one comes with a H710 raid controller. That controller will use your drives to create a single large virtual drive, at BIOS level. </p> <p>So taking advantage of that card, you should consider a setup similar to the following:</p> <ul> <li>You need to provide at least 8 TB of free space but you also think about redundancy so,</li> <li>Get 3x 6TB drives.</li> <li>Create a RAID 5 setup using the raid controller card.</li> <li>You will now have<ul> <li>2x 6TB drives pooled into one large virtual drive (real-world capacity will be 2x 5.46TB)</li> <li>1x 6TB drive configured as parity drive. This means that if one of the above drives fails, the data on the parity drive will be used to restore the data of the failed drive.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>I know it's appealing to use 3x 4TB drives because by a quick logic, excluding parity, 2x 4TB will result in a 8 TB available space, right? But not really.</p> <p>Hard drives have a claimed capacity (by the manufacturer) and a real capacity (seen by the operating system). So a (claimed) 4 TB drive will actually provide 3.64 TB real capacity. So you will be presenting the OS a virtual drive of 2x 3.64 TB which is 7.28 TB real capacity. </p> <p>And with a tier 2 node having a 8 TB requirement, the node will fail to start. So keep that in mind.</p> <p>Of course, given the fact that the Dell R720 in the screenshot above provides 8 HDD trays, you can go ahead and buy 8 drives, setup a RAID 5, and have 7 drives providing storage space to your node and you won't have to worry about running out of space anytime soon.</p> <p>But keep in mind two things: when using a RAID setup, all the drives need to be of the same capacity. You can't use different sizes of drives. And second, providing way more storage capacity than the minimum required, won't bring you more rewards. It will just bring peace of mind that you won't be running out of free space anytime soon.</p> <p>Another thing worth mentioning is the HDD vs SSD topic.</p> <p>A HDD will have an average writing speed of 80MB/s to 160MB/s which is roughly 640Mbps to 1280Mbps. If your internet connection is, for example 100Mbps, your drive write speed will be bottle-necked at 100Mbps so there's actually no need to use SSDs unless you have an internet connection that can keep up with SSD write speeds (eg. 2Gbps or more).</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"stratos-miner-handbook/#connection","title":"Connection","text":"<p>The internet connection plays a crucial and decisive role regarding your node performance. </p> <p>A tier2 has a minimum requirement of 100Mbps upload and download but this is required to any part of the world, not just in your home country. </p> <p>So before investing in hardware, please make sure you connection can actually handle a Tier2 node.</p> <p>To do this, go to speedtest website and select different servers on different continents to make sure your upload/download isn't lower than 100Mbps to any part of the world. </p> <p>As part of the decentralization ideology, you will be receiving files from nodes all over the world, not just from your immediate vicinity. Failing to keep an average speed of 100Mbps will drop the weight (trust) of your node and it will be receiving less and less tasks, which means less and less rewards.</p> <p>Secondly, the port of the node will need to be accessible for incoming TCP/IP connections from the internet. So, if you have a home network setup where the internet cable connects to a router and all the devices using the internet in your location are assigned LAN IPs (192.168.x.x or 172.16.x.x-172.31.x.x or 10.x.x.x), please make sure you have access to the router's configuration page and port forwarding is available.</p> <p>In a setup like this, let's say you get a server and connect a lan cable from the router. The router will most likely assign to the server an IP in the form of 192.168.1.20 for example. You will need to open your router configuration and add a port forwarding rule defining that all traffic (TCP/UDP) incoming and outgoing on node's port (default is 18081), will be forwarded to ip 192.168.1.20.</p> <p>The same rule applies to firewalls that filter traffic. You need to make sure you can properly open (and forward if needed) the node port.</p> <p>Failing to provide an open port to the node will prevent you from even starting it.</p> <p>As for static / dynamic IPs, it doesn't mater, you can run a node on either type.</p> <p>Another thing worth mentioning, the limit for the number of nodes you can run on an IP is 5. So if you have multiple servers on the same network and same IP or just one big powerful server, you can run up to 5 nodes on the same external IP.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"stratos-miner-handbook/#power-consumption","title":"Power consumption","text":"<p>As stated before, the load on the CPU is minimum so there's no intensive power consumption involved.</p> <p>I'm also running a Dell Poweredge R720 and this is the average power consumption:</p> <p></p> <p>This will help you get an idea and maybe calculate an expected cost for electricity.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"stratos-miner-handbook/#optional-ups","title":"Optional: UPS","text":"<p>Having your server connected to an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) is always a good option, even if your electricity connection is stable and only cuts off a few times a year.

There are currently 434 nodes (check for yourself). </p> <p>A simple calculation would be:</p> <p>48 x 6 x 24 = 6912 stos a day divided by 434 nodes = 15 stos a day per node</p> <p>But based on each individual node performance, the amount could be a bit higher or lower.</p> <p>Once you start getting rewards, they are added to your wallet as immature rewards.
